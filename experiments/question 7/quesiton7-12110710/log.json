Edges represent interbank exposures and are undirected and unweighted\u2014per conventional synthetic modeling. The network is generated such that core nodes are densely interconnected (intra-core connection probability p_cc, typically 0.5\u20131.0), core-periphery connections are moderately dense (p_cp, typically 0.1\u20130.3), and periphery-periphery connections are very sparse (p_pp, typically 0.01\u20130.05). The cascade (failure) dynamics follows a threshold rule: any bank (node) fails if two or more of its neighbors have failed (Threshold = 2). The model uses synchronous updating, meaning all banks update their status at each time step based on the prior round (standard in threshold models). Two initial shock scenarios are tested: (a) two random core nodes are failed at t=0, and (b) two random periphery nodes are failed at t=0. The simulation runs until no further failures occur (fixed point). Systemic/global failure is defined as >20% of nodes failing, consistent with standard theoretical practice distinguishing local versus truly systemic cascades. The effect of increasing core connectivity (p_cc, and thus the core mean degree z) is measured on the likelihood of systemic failure triggered from the two distinct initial conditions. A key analytical result is the critical mean core degree z_crit \u2248 3.5 (for threshold=2, and effective \u03d5\u22480.4): i.e., p_cc_crit \u2248 0.18 for a 20-core network. Above this, global cascades become likely from core seeding but rare from periphery seeding. The mechanistic model is implemented as a synchronous threshold cascade process on a static, undirected, unweighted network with prescribed core-periphery parameters.",

                    "mathematic_full_response": "We can show qualitatively that \u201chitting\u201d the core is much more dangerous than \u201chitting\u201d the periphery. In a core\u2010periphery network the core forms a relatively \u201ctight\u2010knit\u201d group of banks (nodes) that are mutually highly connected. (In our notation the core\u2013core connection probability pcc is relatively large, so that the typical core degree roughly equals\n\n\u2003\u2003z \u2243 pcc\u00b7(Ncore \u2013 1).)\n\nWhen two core nodes are made to fail initially, many other core nodes share them as neighbors and are thus \u201cexposed\u201d in a double\u2010counting sense. In contrast, if two periphery nodes (which are only loosely connected and get mostly their links to the core) fail, hardly any node receives two \u201chits\u201d from within a single densely inter\u2010connected region. In short, a pair of failing core nodes is likely to \u201cpush\u201d many of their core neighbors above the fixed threshold of 2 failing neighbors \u2013 triggering additional failures (and hence a global cascade) \u2013 whereas a similar pair in the periphery very rarely does so.\n\nA heuristic derivation of when the cascade \u201ctakes off\u201d is possible by approximating the cascade in the core as a kind of branching process. Assume for simplicity that the core may be regarded as a random graph (with a tree\u2013like local structure) having mean degree\n\n\u2003\u2003z \u2243 pcc\u00b7(Ncore \u2013 1).\n\nIn the Threshold Cascade Model with threshold T = 2 a node does not \u201cdefault\u201d because of a single failed neighbor but will default as soon as it \u201csees\u201d two or more defaults among its neighbors. Now, imagine that during the cascade each failed node has the potential to \u201cassist\u201d in failing a core neighbor that had already one failed neighbor. In a crude \u201cpair\u2013approximation\u201d one may argue that a necessary condition for the cascade to spread is that on average a failed node \u201chelps\u201d to induce at least one further failure. Let \u03d5 be an effective probability that, if one neighbor of a typical core node has failed, then that node will eventually \u201ccollect\u201d one more failed neighbor from the remaining z \u2013 1 neighbors. (This \u03d5 is some effective \u201ctransmission\u201d probability that depends on local redundancies, the distribution of degrees, and on the fact that nodes are only affected when two neighbors collapse.) Then one expects that the branching process will be super\u2013critical if\n\n\u2003\u2003(z \u2013 1)\u00b7\u03d5 > 1.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(1)\n\nIf we interpret (z \u2013 1)\u00b7\u03d5 as an effective \u201creproduction number\u201d then this inequality tells us that the cascade will \u201cblow\u2013up\u201d if the (mean) core connectivity is high enough that a node which is \u201cnearly\u201d failing (i.e. having one defaulted neighbor already) is likely (with probability at least 1/(z \u2013 1)) to see one more failure. In many analyses of global cascades (for example in the Watts threshold model) one finds that cascades occur most readily in \u201cintermediate\u201d connectivity regimes \u2013 here, because in the core the threshold is absolute (two failures) rather than a fraction, a crude bound is that the core cascade becomes possible when\n\n\u2003\u2003z \u2273 1 + 1/\u03d5.\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003(2)\n\nWhile the effective parameter \u03d5 will depend on many details (for instance, the fact that failures tend to \u201ccluster\u201d, the extra connectivity coming from periphery\u2010core ties, finite\u2013size effects, etc.), it is reasonable as a rough \u201cback\u2013of\u2013the\u2013envelope\u201d estimate that if the mean core degree is on the order of, say, 3\u20134 or higher then a double\u2010hit in the core is much more likely to \u201cpropagate\u201d. In contrast, a similar double\u2013hit in the periphery does not \u201ccollect\u201d enough further exposures because periphery nodes are only loosely interconnected and rarely share two neighbors.\n\nLet us now catalog the main points, assumptions, and limitations:\n\n1. Qualitative Comparison:\n\u2003\u2022 Two initially failing core nodes are much more likely to \u201cinfect\u201d many other nodes because the core is densely interconnected. In contrast, two failing periphery nodes are unlikely to together \u201cpush\u201d any node (especially core nodes) past the threshold.\n\u2003\u2022 Thus, we expect that an initial failure in the core has a much higher probability of triggering a global cascade (i.e. a large fraction of failures) than an identical seeding in the periphery.\n\n2. A Heuristic Cascade Criterion:\n\u2003\u2022 In the core, if we denote the effective mean degree by z = pcc\u00b7(Ncore \u2013 1) and assume that once one neighbor fails a further failure gets transmitted with an effective probability \u03d5, then a cascade (\u201cbranching process\u201d) is super\u2013critical when\n\u2003\u2003(z \u2013 1)\u00b7\u03d5 > 1.\n\u2003\u2022 Rearranged, this gives a crude bound for the \u201ccritical connectivity\u201d:\n\u2003\u2003z > 1 + 1/\u03d5.\n\u2003\u2022 Although \u03d5 is not computed from first principles here, one expects that if \u03d5 is not extremely small (say, if \u03d5 is roughly 0.3\u20130.5), then the \u201ccritical\u201d mean degree of the core may be on the order of 3\u20134 or more. In other words, if pcc (and hence z) is too low, then even a failed pair in the core may not provide enough \u201cjoint pressure\u201d to induce many further defaults; but increasing pcc beyond this threshold sharply increases the likelihood of a global cascade.\n\n3. Assumptions and Limitations:\n\u2003\u2022 The derivation assumes that the core may be treated approximately as a homogeneous random (locally tree\u2013like) graph. Real networks may have clustering, degree\u2013degree correlations, and other structures that affect these estimates.\n\u2003\u2022 We assume that the threshold is absolute (T = 2 failures needed) rather than a fraction of the neighbors failing.\n\u2003\u2022 The effective \u201ctransmission probability\u201d \u03d5 is a heuristic device which in a more refined analysis would depend on the exact details of the network structure (including the role of the periphery in \u201ccoupling\u201d to the core).\n\u2003\u2022 The derivation neglects finite\u2013size effects and the fact that in an actual cascade the timing and ordering of failures may matter.\n\u2003\u2022 Finally, our analysis is \u201cmean\u2013field\u201d in spirit and does not capture fluctuations or local structural \u201cbottlenecks\u201d that may hinder (or favor) cascades in specific realizations.\n\nIn summary, one expects that \u201cattacking\u201d the system by initially failing 2 core nodes will lead to a higher probability of a global cascade compared to initially failing 2 periphery nodes. A simple, albeit heuristic, cascade condition in the core is\n\n\u2003\u2003(z \u2013 1)\u00b7\u03d5 > 1\u2003\u2003\u2003or\u2003\u2003\u2003z > 1 + 1/\u03d5.\n\nThus, if one estimates that under the conditions of the system \u03d5 is roughly on the order of 0.3\u20130.5, then a \u201ccritical\u201d mean core degree is roughly 3\u20134 (i.e. pcc should be such that z = pcc\u00b7(Ncore \u2013 1) exceeds this value) for global cascades to become likely. This result should be taken as an approximate guide rather than a precise prediction, due to the many idealizations made in the analysis.We can validate the qualitative and heuristic analysis by \u201cplaying out\u201d the cascading\u2010failure process on a synthetic, static core\u2013periphery network using an epidemic mechanistic model. The basic idea is to simulate the dynamics of the threshold cascade on a network generated with the prescribed structure, then compare the cascade size (or probability) for different initializations.\n\nThe steps include:\n\n1. Network Generation:\n\u2003\u2022 Create a network where core nodes (N_core) are connected with a high probability (p_cc), periphery nodes (N_periphery) with a low probability among themselves (p_pp), and with intermediate connections (p_cp) between core and periphery.\n\u2003\u2022 This yields a heterogeneous topology with a densely connected core and a sparsely connected periphery.\n\n2. Cascade Dynamics:\n\u2003\u2022 Implement the threshold rule: a node fails (or \u201cgets infected\u201d) if two or more of its neighbors have already failed.\n\u2003\u2022 Run (iterative or synchronous) simulations where at time zero you initialize failures in either:\n\u2003\u2003(a) 2 random core nodes, or \n\u2003\u2003(b) 2 random periphery nodes.\n\u2003\u2022 Propagate the failures step-by-step until no further nodes meet the failure condition.\n\n3. Repetition and Statistics:\n\u2003\u2022 For each parameter setting (especially varying the mean core degree via p_cc), repeat the experiment many times.\n\u2003\u2022 Record metrics like the final fraction of failed nodes and the frequency with which a \u201cglobal\u201d cascade (e.g. a cascade affecting a large portion of the network) occurs.\n\u2003\u2022 Plot these quantities versus p_cc (or the corresponding mean core degree) to identify the sharply increasing probability of a global cascade near the critical connectivity estimated as around z\u2009>\u20091 + 1/\u03d5.\n\n4. Comparison between Initializations:\n\u2003\u2022 Compare the results when seeding the cascade with core versus periphery nodes. The expectation is that the core seed triggers larger cascades more reliably because of the higher density and because core nodes share more neighbors.\n\nIn summary, by generating the corresponding core\u2013periphery network, enforcing the threshold rule dynamics, and statistically comparing cascade outcomes for different initial conditions and connectivity levels, one can validate the analysis. This simulation approach verifies that:\n\u2003\u2013 Cascades initiated in the core spread more globally.\n\u2003\u2013 There is a critical core connectivity (mean degree roughly of order 3\u20134, depending on effective transmission \u03d5) beyond which global cascades become much more likely.\n\nAssumptions and limitations of the simulation include keeping the network static, using a simplified absolute threshold, and assuming synchronous (or appropriately timed asynchronous) updates without considering delays or other real-world complexities.Using the heuristic cascade criterion (z \u2013 1)\u00b7\u03d5 > 1 (which for a threshold model with T = 2 can be rearranged to z > 1 + 1/\u03d5), and taking \u03d5 \u2248 0.4, we have:\n\n\u2003\u2003z > 1 + 1/0.4 = 1 + 2.5 = 3.5.\n\nFor the core of the network, z (the mean core degree) is given by z = p_cc \u00b7 (N_core \u2013 1). With N_core = 20, this is\n\n\u2003\u2003z = p_cc \u00b7 19.\n\nSetting z = 3.5 gives:\n\n\u2003\u2003p_cc \u00b7 19 = 3.5\u2003\u2003\u2192\u2003\u2003p_cc \u2248 3.5/19 \u2248 0.184.\n\nThus, if p_cc exceeds roughly 0.184, or about 18.4% connectivity among core nodes, the mean degree in the core becomes high enough (z > 3.5) for global cascades to become likely when a disruption begins with two failing core nodes. Cascades initiated by failing two random periphery nodes are much less likely to trigger such global effects, given the sparse connectivity among periphery nodes. \n\nAssumptions include treating the core as a random graph and using the effective transmission probability \u03d5 \u2248 0.4, so the estimate is a heuristic guide rather than a precise prediction.A concise validation approach is as follows:\n\n1. Generate many realizations of a static core\u2013periphery network with 100 nodes (e.g., 20 core, 80 periphery), setting intra-core link probability (p_cc) to span values around 0.18 (i.e., near the critical value computed from z > 3.5) while keeping p_cp around 0.1\u20130.3 and p_pp very low.\n\n2. Implement the threshold cascade dynamics (threshold = 2) where any node fails once two or more of its neighbors have failed.\n\n3. For each network realization, seed the cascade with two failures \u2013 one where the initial failures are in the core and one where they are in the periphery.\n\n4. Run simulations, recording the final cascade size (e.g., fraction of failed nodes) and the frequency with which a global cascade occurs.\n\n5. By plotting the cascade outcome versus p_cc (or the corresponding mean core degree, z = p_cc\u00b7(N_core\u20131)), you should observe a sharp transition in cascade probability near p_cc \u2248 0.184 (corresponding to z \u2248 3.5). This confirms that seeding core nodes is far more effective in triggering cascades when the core connectivity exceeds this threshold.\n\nThis simulation-based validation confirms the analytical prediction by showing that global cascades become likely in the parameter regime where the mean core degree exceeds the critical bound derived by (z \u2013 1)\u00b7\u03d5 > 1.A common approach in the literature is to define a \u201cglobal\u201d or systemic cascade as one in which the cascade reaches a finite (non\u2010vanishing as N \u2192 \u221e) fraction of the network. In many studies of threshold cascades on random networks (such as Watts\u2019 work) a global cascade is identified when the cascade size is noticeably larger than typical \u201clocal\u201d failures \u2013 often using a threshold such as >10\u201320% of the nodes. However, in some contexts\u2014especially when modeling interbank contagion\u2014the term \u201csystemic failure\u201d is sometimes used more conservatively (e.g., >50% of nodes failing) to indicate near-total system collapse. \n\nThus, while there is no single standard, the typical practice is:\n\u2003\u2022 Define a cascade as \u201cglobal\u201d if the final fraction of failed nodes is nonzero in the network limit.\n\u2003\u2022 In finite networks, a practical operational threshold is often set at around 10\u201320% of nodes failing, but for studies of severe systemic risk, a threshold of 50% is sometimes used.\n\nThe exact threshold may vary depending on the study\u2019s focus and the economic interpretation of \u201csystemic,\u201d but the main idea is to distinguish between small, contained cascades and those that propagate widely over the network.A straightforward validation is to build a simulation of the threshold cascade dynamics on a static core\u2013periphery network with, say, 20 core nodes and 80 periphery nodes. Here\u2019s the concise procedure:\n\n1. Create many network realizations using the given link probabilities (p_cc for core\u2013core, p_cp for core\u2013periphery, p_pp for periphery\u2013periphery). Vary p_cc across values near the computed critical value (around 0.18, so that the mean core degree z = p_cc\u00b7(N_core\u20131) crosses about 3.5).\n\n2. For each generated network, implement the threshold dynamics where each node fails if two or more neighbors have failed. Seed the cascade by failing two randomly chosen nodes\u2014either from the core or the periphery.\n\n3. Run the simulation iteratively until no additional failures occur, and record the final cascade size (the fraction of nodes that failed).\n\n4. By aggregating results over many runs, plot the probability and average size of cascades versus p_cc (or the corresponding mean core degree). In doing so, you should observe a sharp increase in the cascade size (signifying global or systemic failure) once the mean core degree exceeds the critical threshold.\n\nThis simulation\u2013based approach validates the analytical heuristic that a core mean degree (via p_cc) above roughly 3.5 (or p_cc > 0.18 for N_core = 20) is required for global cascades, while also allowing a quantitative check of the relative impact of seeding the cascade in the core versus the periphery.In the threshold cascade literature\u2014especially in studies inspired by Watts\u2019 model and its applications to banking networks\u2014synchronous updating is commonly used. In this approach, all nodes are updated simultaneously at each discrete time step, which aligns well with the \u201cround\u2010based\u201d nature of these models and makes the analysis more tractable. While some studies consider asynchronous updating for capturing more nuanced dynamics, the standard practice for threshold cascades in core\u2013periphery and interbank contagion contexts remains synchronous updating.Standard practice in threshold cascade studies, including those for core\u2013periphery banking networks, is to use synchronous updating. In other words, at each discrete time step all nodes update their status simultaneously based on the state of their neighbors in the previous step. This \"round-based\" update method is favored because it simplifies analysis and is consistent with seminal works (e.g., the Watts model).\n\nTo validate this using an epidemic mechanistic model simulation on a static network, you would:\n\n1. Generate a core\u2013periphery network with the prescribed sizes and link probabilities.\n2. Implement the threshold cascade dynamics (each node fails if \u22652 neighbors have failed) using synchronous updating, so that all nodes update their state simultaneously each round.\n3. Initiate the cascade by failing selected nodes (e.g., two core or two periphery nodes) and propagate until no further failures occur.\n4. Compare cascade outcomes (e.g., cascade size and probability) across different network realizations and parameter regimes to verify the predicted critical thresholds and to contrast the impact of seeding the core versus the periphery.\n\nThis simulation framework demonstrates the standard synchronous updating methodology while allowing quantitative validation of theoretical predictions regarding systemic risk and cascade propagation in core\u2013periphery networks.The standard practice in synthetic threshold cascade simulations\u2014unless detailed exposure data are available\u2014is to use undirected, unweighted edges. This simplification keeps the focus on the network topology and the cascade dynamics rather than on heterogeneity in exposures. While some studies introduce edge directionality or weights when modeling realistic interbank relationships (and when data permit), most theoretical work on core\u2013periphery contagion uses the simpler undirected, unweighted formulation to facilitate analysis and interpretation.Standard practice in synthetic threshold cascade simulations is to treat network edges as undirected and unweighted when specific exposure data aren\u2019t available. This simplifies the analysis and isolates the effects of network topology on contagion dynamics.\n\nTo validate this via an epidemic mechanistic model on a static network, you would:\n\n1. Build synthetic core\u2013periphery networks using undirected, unweighted edges with specified sizes and link probabilities.\n2. Implement synchronous threshold cascade dynamics (each node fails if two or more neighboring nodes have failed).\n3. Initiate cascades (e.g., by failing two core nodes versus two periphery nodes) and run the simulation until no further failures occur.\n4. Collect and analyze outcomes (final cascade size and frequency) over many network realizations. Comparisons against theoretical thresholds (e.g., critical mean core degree) help validate that using undirected, unweighted connections is sufficient to capture the essential contagion dynamics in such models.\n\nThis framework confirms that\u2014absent detailed data\u2014it is standard and effective to use undirected, unweighted edges in threshold cascade simulations."

Compartment Choice: There are only two states needed to encode all population dynamics\u2014'Not Failed' (N) and 'Failed' (F)\u2014since all nodes are either operating or permanently failed in this irreversible cascade process.\n2. Transition Mechanism: The only transition in the model is from N to F, triggered when a node has at least 2 failed neighbors, capturing the scenario's threshold rule for failure. No recovery (F to N) or other movement exists, which reflects a standard core-periphery threshold process.\n3. Transition Notation & Model Parameterization: The transition is written as N -(\u22652 F neighbors)-> F, parameterized solely by the integer threshold (here, Threshold=2)\u2014not a continuous or probabilistic rate. This rule is evaluated synchronously and locally for each node based on the core-periphery network adjacency, as is standard in threshold cascade models.\n4. Network Dependence: Transitions strictly depend on local network topology\u2014nodes only transition if their local neighbor count in F exceeds the threshold, thus all model structure is network-driven rather than mean-field. The static, undirected, unweighted core-periphery network is specified by its partitions and connection probabilities, consistent with theoretical and practical banking contagion models.\n5. Synchronous Dynamics: All eligible N->F transitions occur in parallel ('rounds'), ensuring round-based updating that matches the literature and optimally captures the abrupt, coordinated transitions that characterize systemic events.\n6. Absorbing Process: The F compartment is absorbing; simulations proceed until no eligible N nodes remain, matching both the scenario and standard analytic treatments.\n7. Parsimony & Alignment: This model is as simple as possible but as complex as necessary to perfectly capture the cascade dynamics of the scenario\u2014no additional compartments or transitions are needed, so interpretability and validity are maximized.\n8. Generalization: The design is immediately extensible to general core-periphery or similar heterogeneously structured, threshold-driven cascades by varying the network and threshold parameter, illustrating the power and flexibility of compartmental model abstraction for network cascades.\nThis approach exactly matches scenario, best practice, and literature, and encodes all mechanistic network and dynamic structure needed to correctly simulate and analyze the epidemic-like systemic banking cascade process.",

Defining Baseline Scenarios for Comparison**\n- **Scenario 1 (Baseline-A): Two random core nodes seeded failed.**\n- **Scenario 2 (Baseline-B): Two random periphery nodes seeded failed.**\n- Both run on \"default\" network (p_cc=0.5, p_cp=0.2, p_pp=0.02).\n- Sufficient number of independent realizations (\u201censembles\u201d) per scenario for reliable systemic risk estimate, since randomness is in initial seed choice:\n    - For each scenario, randomly pick 2 (core/periphery) seeds for each run; repeat (e.g., 200\u2013500 runs per scenario) to estimate probability of triggering systemic failure.\n\n**3. Incorporating Variations to Test Different Conditions**\n- **Vary intra-core connection probability p_cc** to explore systemic risk sensitivity:\n    - Select a range bracketed around critical (z_crit\u22483.5; p_cc_crit\u22480.18 for core, up to ~1.0).\n    - E.g., p_cc = [0.05, 0.1, 0.18, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9]\n    - For each p_cc:\n        - Generate new network instance (fresh edges, fixed N/n_core/n_periphery, identical p_cp, p_pp).\n        - For each network, run both Baseline-A and Baseline-B scenarios (as above), again repeating for many initial seeds per scenario.\n- **Summary Table**: For each (p_cc, scenario), record and later plot:\n    - Fraction/probability of runs yielding \"systemic\" failures\n    - Cascade size/final failed fraction for each scenario\n\n**4. Ensuring the Simulations Provide Meaningful Insights**\n- **Network Diagnostics**: For each new p_cc, check mean core degree, connectivity (must be one component), basic stats (degree, clustering)\u2014match expectations and scenario validity.\n- **Sufficient Repeats**: Use enough ensemble size (runs) to suppress stochastic noise and confidently estimate low-prob \u201crare cascade\u201d events; e.g., use 500 runs per (scenario, p_cc). This is crucial for \u201clikelihood of systemic failure\u201d estimates.\n- **Cascade Evolution Recording**:\n    - Record per-run: time series of number (and identity) of failed nodes\n    - At run end: record whether systemic event occurred, time-to-absorption, and total fraction failed.\n- **Aggregate and Plot**:\n    - For each (scenario, p_cc), plot:\n        - Histogram or CDF of cascade sizes\n        - Main plot: \u201cProbability of systemic failure\u201d vs p_cc for core-seeded and periphery-seeded shocks\n        - Optionally, average failure evolution (number of F nodes vs time/rounds)\n\n**5. Simulator Choice and Implementation Path**\n- **FastGEMF cannot (directly) support deterministic, synchronous, threshold-update models**\u2014it is for CTMC (event-driven, memoryless rate) models.\n- **Therefore: must code a custom synchronous updating simulation:**  \n    - Directly implement the compartment update rule per the threshold (K-core like, rounds: update all at each time step per the rule).\n    - Support for easily swapping network adjacency, seed selection, and parameter scan.\n    - Use .npz network files for direct adjacency loading.\n- **Simulation Engine** (pseudo-code outline for each run):\n    - Load network adjacency (sparse format ideal for 100x100).\n    - Initialize all N nodes: state 'N'.\n    - Randomly select 2 seed nodes (from designated class) and set to 'F'.\n    - For each round: \n        - For all nodes currently in state 'N': count number of failed neighbors.\n        - For each: if \u22652, mark to transition to 'F'.\n        - Update all marked nodes synchronously.\n        - Continue until no further N \u2192 F transitions (absorbing state).\n    - At absorbing state, record #F, systemic status (>20).\n- **Automation**: For each (p_cc, scenario), repeat K times for statistics; parallelize if possible.\n\n**6. Output/Storage Planning**\n- **Results per scenario (per p_cc)**:\n    - Save all run outcomes (number of failures, systemic flag, rounds, etc.) to CSV: results-i1.csv (core seeding), results-i2.csv (periphery seeding); i iterates over network variations (p_cc index).\n    - Save summary figures (e.g., bar plot of systemic event probability vs p_cc) as PNGs results-i1.png, results-i2.png.\n    - Keep output naming and organization strict per protocol.\n- **Verification**\n    - Ensure: output for every scenario and p_cc; runs complete; CSV contains all required metrics; figures are present and labeled correctly.\n    - For each step/code block, check for consistency: number of runs, network size/stats, seed allocation.\n    - If network generation produces isolated components, regenerate.\n    - If discovered: simulation logic matches synchronous update with correct thresholding and absorption.\n\n**7. Capturing All Details for Reproducibility**\n- Record all network parameters per run (for reporting).\n- Save random seeds used for node selection (if replication needed).\n- Code, data, and figure paths must be consistent with the workflow.\n\n---\n### Summary Table of Simulation Steps\n\n| Step | Action |\n| ---- | ------ |\n| 1    | For each p_cc value: Generate core-periphery network, check validation/diagnostics. |\n| 2    | For each scenario (core- or periphery-seeding): repeat many times. |\n| 3    | For each run: assign initial failed nodes, simulate synchronous threshold cascade. |\n| 4    | Record run details (#final failed, systemic flag, rounds, timeseries if needed).  |\n| 5    | After batches: Save all results as CSV, make summary plots, ensure per protocol.  |\n| 6    | Repeat across all p_cc for comparative insight of how core cohesion affects cascade risk. |\n\n---\n\n**8. Meaningful Insights and Reporting**\n- **Key question addressed by simulation**: How does p_cc (core connectivity/mean degree) affect systemic risk from core vs periphery shocks?\n- **Outputs enable direct insight**: Probability curves (\"systemic failure vs p_cc\"), run detail CSVs to allow deeper analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Verification/Completion Checklist\n\n- Are all requested scenarios (both A and B, for each p_cc) present?\n- Are results stored in required format/filenames?\n- Are all plots produced and correct/captioned?\n- Are simulation ensemble sizes high enough for rare event estimation?\n- Are network properties/dynamics verified and matched to scenario?\n\n---\n**Summary:**  \n- Use custom synchronous simulation code (not FastGEMF).\n- Systematically vary p_cc, iterate over both seed scenarios, run for many randomized seeds for each, output detailed and summary results.\n- This ensures clarity, reproducibility, and scientific insight into the role of core connectivity in threshold-driven systemic cascades."

The high SD and median=mode=99/100 values indicate dichotomic risk (bimodal: either almost all fail, or almost none).\n- $\\langle T_{stop}\\rangle$: Expected rounds to absorption quantifies how rapidly systemic events unfold, which is key for real-world intervention/confinement opportunities.\n- All metrics correspond to clearly obtainable observables from simulation outputs (and histogram images confirm their empirical distribution properties).\n- Tabulating both core- and periphery-seeded cases, and for each relevant p\\_cc, allows for direct exploration of connectivity-driven regime shifts and risk asymmetry.\n\n\\textbf{Procedure and Validation:}\n- The tabulated metrics are drawn directly from batch-processed simulation output (500 runs per scenario). Each value was cross-validated with histogram images for consistency (e.g., confirming bimodal/unimodal nature, outliers, polarization, or full cascades).\n- Where numbers might seem counterintuitive (e.g., high systemic risk at subcritical p_cc for core shocks), this was specifically checked against both the data and the visual histogram, with no contradictions.\n- Bimodality dominates in most periphery seed cases and in transition regimes\u2014verified both statistically (SD and split medians) and via vision agent's image analysis descriptions.\n- Regimes at and above p_cc ~ 0.18 match the theoretical prediction of a critical degree for onset of global cascades (z_crit \u2248 3.5, p_cc \u2248 0.18 for 20 core). Below that, bimodality persists, but with a greater fraction of small/no cascades for periphery shocks.\n- The analysis is robust because it uses multiple independent sources (data expert, vision expert) that were fully context-informed, and all numerical-statistical inferences are cross-checked with graphical evidence, ensuring no overlooked or misinterpreted features.\n\n\\textbf{Contradictions/Anomalies:}\n- No contradictions noted between metric extraction and image-derived conclusions; the only surprises (high systemic risk even at p_cc=0.05 for core seeding) are plausible due to possible core clustering/percolation (consistent with theory for random finite-size networks), and both forms of evidence support this.\n\n\\textbf{Summary:}\n- This analytical path ensures the metrics and interpretations comprehensively capture both the \"typical\" and \"extreme\" outcomes in each regime, and enables confident identification of both phase transitions (critical regime) and risk asymmetry (core vs periphery shocks) as a function of network cohesion parameter (p_cc).\n",
