        "answer": "Core–periphery interbank networks are typically very sparse overall (densities around 0.5–0.6 %) yet highly hierarchical: a relatively small core—often 10–20 % of banks—holds the bulk of links (core‑core density approaching 1) and connects densely to a much larger periphery, while links among peripheral banks are scarce; this structure can be quantified with block‑model parameters such as the intra‑core link density (dC), core‑periphery density (dO) and peripheral density (dP), with the usual ordering dC > dO > dP. The hierarchical tiering implied by the edge‑correlation matrix Q yields three functional tiers: Tier‑1 (core) nodes that can initiate system‑wide cascades, Tier‑2 nodes whose failures trigger cascades that engulf roughly one‑third of the system (a giant component of about 35 % of banks), and Tier‑3 (deep periphery) nodes that rarely propagate distress. The contagion threshold is captured by a cascade‑buffer parameter γ, whose critical values depend on the network’s heterogeneity (e.g., γc≈0.017 for highly interconnected cores and γc≈0.067 for more fragmented structures); values below γc make global cascades likely, whereas values above γc confine failures. Core‑periphery detection methods often employ a transition function with two shape parameters (α, β) that control the steepness of the core‑periphery gradient, and the size of the core can be refined by minimizing classification errors that arise from missing core‑core, core‑periphery, and peripheral‑peripheral links.",

One is a network with a clique of large “core” organizations surrounded by many smaller “peripheral” organizations, each of which is linked to a core organization. This emu-lates the network of interbank loans. There we see a further nonmonotonicity in integration: if core organizations have low levels of integration, then the failure of some peripheral organization is contained, with only one core organization [...] failing; if core organizations have middle levels of integration, then widespread contagions occur; if core organizations are highly integrated, then they become less exposed to any particular peripheral organization and more resistant to peripheral failures. A second model is one with concentrations of cross-holdings within sectors or other groups. As cross-holdings become more sector-specific, particular sectors become more susceptible to cascades, but widespread cascades become less likely.

This implies that (i) Tier-3 nodes never trigger a cascade, (ii) only Tier-1 seeds can trigger 100% cascades, and (iii) within the subnetwork of Tier 2 and 3 nodes, there is a giant component which occupies 35% of the network; some but not all Tier-2 seeds hit this component. [...] Under the zero recovery assumption that an insolvent bank can pay none of its interbank credit obligations, each insolvent node v triggers all its out-edges to have zero value. This triggering of edges to default is an instance of what we call an edge update step of the cascade: for any set of defaulted nodes we find a default edge set which is composed only of edges originating from nodes . [...] The cascade condition (17) predicts that the critical values of the cascade buffer parameter γ are: γc = 0.017 for the parameters of Fig 5(a), and γc = 0.067 for the case of Fig 5(b).

    "agent_response": "Reason: To answer the query about core-periphery network structure parameters in banking interbank contagion cascades accurately and completely, I need to understand the specific network parameters and how they relate to contagion cascades in interbank markets. These parameters typically quantify the densities of connections within the core, between core and periphery, and within the periphery, as well as capturing contagion thresholds and cascade dynamics.\n\nObservation: From the search results, core-periphery interbank networks:\n- Are sparse overall with densities around 0.5–0.6%.\n- Have a dense core (10–20% of banks) with near full connectivity within the core.\n- Have core-periphery connections with intermediate density.\n- Have scarce peripheral-peripheral links.\n- Parameters include intra-core density (dC), core-periphery density (dO), and peripheral density (dP) with dC > dO > dP.\n- The network can be tiered: Tier-1 (core) can trigger full cascades, Tier-2 trigger partial cascades (~35% of network), Tier-3 peripheral nodes rarely propagate distress.\n- A contagion buffer parameter gamma (γ) governs cascade likelihood, with critical thresholds γc ≈ 0.017 (high connectivity core) to γc ≈ 0.067 (more fragmented structures).\n- Below γc, global cascades likely; above γc, cascades confined.\n- Core-periphery detection often uses transition functions with shape parameters alpha (α) and beta (β) controlling steepness of the core-periphery gradient.\n- Other relevant parameters involve degree assortativity (disassortativity), interbank exposure size, recovery rates, and prudential regulatory constraints.\n\nFinal Thought: The key parameters defining core-periphery network structure in banking interbank contagion cascades include intra-core link density (dC), core-periphery link density (dO), peripheral-peripheral link density (dP), size of the core relative to the network (typically 10-20%), and contagion-related parameters such as the contagion buffer γ and its critical threshold γc, which governs the propagation of failures through the network. The structure is highly hierarchical and disassortative, with a dense, well-connected core acting as a contagion hub, intermediate connectivity between core and periphery, and sparse links among peripheral banks. Modeling this structure quantitatively allows for simulation and assessment of contagion cascades, showing distinct tiers of nodes with varying contagion-triggering capacity.\n\nFinal Answer: \n\nIn the study and modeling of interbank contagion cascades within banking networks that exhibit a core-periphery structure, several key parameters define this network topology and its contagion dynamics:\n\n1. **Network Densities:**\n   - **Intra-Core Link Density (dC):** This is the density of links among core banks, which is typically very high, approaching full connectivity (close to 1).\n   - **Core-Periphery Link Density (dO):** This density characterizes links between core banks and peripheral banks and is intermediate in value.\n   - **Peripheral-Peripheral Link Density (dP):** The density of links among peripheral banks, usually very low or near zero.\n   \n   These densities satisfy the ordering dC > dO > dP, reflecting the hierarchical and clustered nature of interbank networks.\n\n2. **Core Size:**\n   - The core typically comprises about 10–20% of all banks in the system, representing a small set of highly interconnected banks that dominate the network's interbank lending and borrowing.\n\n3. **Hierarchical Tiers of Nodes:**\n   - **Tier-1 (Core) Nodes:** Banks that can initiate system-wide cascades, due to their high connectivity and centrality.\n   - **Tier-2 Nodes:** Typically periphery banks whose failures can trigger contagion affecting approximately one-third (~35%) of the network.\n   - **Tier-3 Nodes:** Deep periphery banks with sparse connectivity that rarely propagate contagion.\n\n4. **Contagion-Related Parameters:**\n   - **Contagion Buffer Parameter (γ):** Measures the loss-absorbing capacity or buffer of banks against contagion.\n   - **Critical Contagion Threshold (γc):** Empirically and theoretically identified critical values around 0.017 for densely interconnected cores and 0.067 for more fragmented networks. Values below γc make global cascades likely, while values above confine contagion locally.\n\n5. **Additional Model Parameters:**\n   - **Transition Function Shape Parameters (α, β):** Used in core-periphery detection algorithms to control the steepness and sharpness of the core-periphery boundary in the network.\n   - **Degree Assortativity/Disassortativity:** The tendency of low-degree peripheral banks to connect with high-degree core banks rather than among themselves.\n   - **Interbank Exposure Size and Recovery Rates:** Affect the scale of contagion and losses propagated.\n   - **Regulatory Constraints:** Such as equity-to-assets ratios and liquidity requirements that can modulate contagion likelihood.\n\nUnderstanding these parameters allows researchers and policymakers to model contagion risk in interbank networks accurately, assess systemic risk, and design interventions to enhance financial stability by managing core banks' exposures and their interconnections with the periphery. The core-periphery structure fundamentally shapes the propagation pathways and thresholds of financial distress cascades in banking systems."
