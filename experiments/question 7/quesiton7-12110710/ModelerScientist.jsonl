The network is generated such that core nodes are densely interconnected (intra-core connection probability p_cc, typically 0.5–1.0), core-periphery connections are moderately dense (p_cp, typically 0.1–0.3), and periphery-periphery connections are very sparse (p_pp, typically 0.01–0.05). The cascade (failure) dynamics follows a threshold rule: any bank (node) fails if two or more of its neighbors have failed (Threshold = 2). The model uses synchronous updating, meaning all banks update their status at each time step based on the prior round (standard in threshold models). Two initial shock scenarios are tested: (a) two random core nodes are failed at t=0, and (b) two random periphery nodes are failed at t=0.

In a core‐periphery network the core forms a relatively “tight‐knit” group of banks (nodes) that are mutually highly connected. (In our notation the core–core connection probability pcc is relatively large, so that the typical core degree roughly equals\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003z ≃ pcc·(Ncore – 1).)\\n\\nWhen two core nodes are made to fail initially, many other core nodes share them as neighbors and are thus “exposed” in a double‐counting sense. In contrast, if two periphery nodes (which are only loosely connected and get mostly their links to the core) fail, hardly any node receives two “hits” from within a single densely inter‐connected region. In short, a pair of failing core nodes is likely to “push” many of their core neighbors above the fixed threshold of 2 failing neighbors – triggering additional failures (and hence a global cascade) – whereas a similar pair in the periphery very rarely does so.\\n\\nA heuristic derivation of when the cascade “takes off” is possible by approximating the cascade in the core as a kind of branching process. Assume for simplicity that the core may be regarded as a random graph (with a tree–like local structure) having mean degree\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003z ≃ pcc·(Ncore – 1).\\n\\nIn the Threshold Cascade Model with threshold T = 2 a node does not “default” because of a single failed neighbor but will default as soon as it “sees” two or more defaults among its neighbors. Now, imagine that during the cascade each failed node has the potential to “assist” in failing a core neighbor that had already one failed neighbor. In a crude “pair–approximation” one may argue that a necessary condition for the cascade to spread is that on average a failed node “helps” to induce at least one further failure. Let ϕ be an effective probability that, if one neighbor of a typical core node has failed, then that node will eventually “collect” one more failed neighbor from the remaining z – 1 neighbors. (This ϕ is some effective “transmission” probability that depends on local redundancies, the distribution of degrees, and on the fact that nodes are only affected when two neighbors collapse.) Then one expects that the branching process will be super–critical if\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003(z – 1)·ϕ > 1.\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003(1)\\n\\nIf we interpret (z – 1)·ϕ as an effective “reproduction number” then this inequality tells us that the cascade will “blow–up” if the (mean) core connectivity is high enough that a node which is “nearly” failing (i.e. having one defaulted neighbor already) is likely (with probability at least 1/(z – 1)) to see one more failure. In many analyses of global cascades (for example in the Watts threshold model) one finds that cascades occur most readily in “intermediate” connectivity regimes – here, because in the core the threshold is absolute (two failures) rather than a fraction, a crude bound is that the core cascade becomes possible when\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003z ≳ 1 + 1/ϕ.\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003(2)\\n\\nWhile the effective parameter ϕ will depend on many details (for instance, the fact that failures tend to “cluster”, the extra connectivity coming from periphery‐core ties, finite–size effects, etc.), it is reasonable as a rough “back–of–the–envelope” estimate that if the mean core degree is on the order of, say, 3–4 or higher then a double‐hit in the core is much more likely to “propagate”. In contrast, a similar double–hit in the periphery does not “collect” enough further exposures because periphery nodes are only loosely interconnected and rarely share two neighbors.\\n\\nLet us now catalog the main points, assumptions, and limitations:\\n\\n1. Qualitative Comparison:\\n\\u2003• Two initially failing core nodes are much more likely to “infect” many other nodes because the core is densely interconnected. In contrast, two failing periphery nodes are unlikely to together “push” any node (especially core nodes) past the threshold.\\n\\u2003• Thus, we expect that an initial failure in the core has a much higher probability of triggering a global cascade (i.e. a large fraction of failures) than an identical seeding in the periphery.\\n\\n2. A Heuristic Cascade Criterion:\\n\\u2003• In the core, if we denote the effective mean degree by z = pcc·(Ncore – 1) and assume that once one neighbor fails a further failure gets transmitted with an effective probability ϕ, then a cascade (“branching process”) is super–critical when\\n\\u2003\\u2003(z – 1)·ϕ > 1.\\n\\u2003• Rearranged, this gives a crude bound for the “critical connectivity”:\\n\\u2003\\u2003z > 1 + 1/ϕ.\\n\\u2003• Although ϕ is not computed from first principles here, one expects that if ϕ is not extremely small (say, if ϕ is roughly 0.3–0.5), then the “critical” mean degree of the core may be on the order of 3–4 or more. In other words, if pcc (and hence z) is too low, then even a failed pair in the core may not provide enough “joint pressure” to induce many further defaults; but increasing pcc beyond this threshold sharply increases the likelihood of a global cascade.\\n\\n3. Assumptions and Limitations:\\n\\u2003• The derivation assumes that the core may be treated approximately as a homogeneous random (locally tree–like) graph. Real networks may have clustering, degree–degree correlations, and other structures that affect these estimates.\\n\\u2003• We assume that the threshold is absolute (T = 2 failures needed) rather than a fraction of the neighbors failing.\\n\\u2003• The effective “transmission probability” ϕ is a heuristic device which in a more refined analysis would depend on the exact details of the network structure (including the role of the periphery in “coupling” to the core).\\n\\u2003• The derivation neglects finite–size effects and the fact that in an actual cascade the timing and ordering of failures may matter.\\n\\u2003• Finally, our analysis is “mean–field” in spirit and does not capture fluctuations or local structural “bottlenecks” that may hinder (or favor) cascades in specific realizations.\\n\\nIn summary, one expects that “attacking” the system by initially failing 2 core nodes will lead to a higher probability of a global cascade compared to initially failing 2 periphery nodes. A simple, albeit heuristic, cascade condition in the core is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003(z – 1)·ϕ > 1\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003or\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003z > 1 + 1/ϕ.\\n\\nThus, if one estimates that under the conditions of the system ϕ is roughly on the order of 0.3–0.5, then a “critical” mean core degree is roughly 3–4 (i.e. pcc should be such that z = pcc·(Ncore – 1) exceeds this value) for global cascades to become likely. This result should be taken as an approximate guide rather than a precise prediction, due to the many idealizations made in the analysis.We can validate the qualitative and heuristic analysis by “playing out” the cascading‐failure process on a synthetic, static core–periphery network using an epidemic mechanistic model. The basic idea is to simulate the dynamics of the threshold cascade on a network generated with the prescribed structure, then compare the cascade size (or probability) for different initializations.\\n\\nThe steps include:\\n\\n1. Network Generation:\\n\\u2003• Create a network where core nodes (N_core) are connected with a high probability (p_cc), periphery nodes (N_periphery) with a low probability among themselves (p_pp), and with intermediate connections (p_cp) between core and periphery.\\n\\u2003• This yields a heterogeneous topology with a densely connected core and a sparsely connected periphery.\\n\\n2. Cascade Dynamics:\\n\\u2003• Implement the threshold rule: a node fails (or “gets infected”) if two or more of its neighbors have already failed.\\n\\u2003• Run (iterative or synchronous) simulations where at time zero you initialize failures in either:\\n\\u2003\\u2003(a) 2 random core nodes, or \\n\\u2003\\u2003(b) 2 random periphery nodes.\\n\\u2003• Propagate the failures step-by-step until no further nodes meet the failure condition.\\n\\n3. Repetition and Statistics:\\n\\u2003• For each parameter setting (especially varying the mean core degree via p_cc), repeat the experiment many times.\\n\\u2003• Record metrics like the final fraction of failed nodes and the frequency with which a “global” cascade (e.g. a cascade affecting a large portion of the network) occurs.\\n\\u2003• Plot these quantities versus p_cc (or the corresponding mean core degree) to identify the sharply increasing probability of a global cascade near the critical connectivity estimated as around z\\u2009>\\u20091 + 1/ϕ.\\n\\n4. Comparison between Initializations:\\n\\u2003• Compare the results when seeding the cascade with core versus periphery nodes. The expectation is that the core seed triggers larger cascades more reliably because of the higher density and because core nodes share more neighbors.\\n\\nIn summary, by generating the corresponding core–periphery network, enforcing the threshold rule dynamics, and statistically comparing cascade outcomes for different initial conditions and connectivity levels, one can validate the analysis. This simulation approach verifies that:\\n\\u2003– Cascades initiated in the core spread more globally.\\n\\u2003– There is a critical core connectivity (mean degree roughly of order 3–4, depending on effective transmission ϕ) beyond which global cascades become much more likely.\\n\\nAssumptions and limitations of the simulation include keeping the network static, using a simplified absolute threshold, and assuming synchronous (or appropriately timed asynchronous) updates without considering delays or other real-world complexities.Using the heuristic cascade criterion (z – 1)·ϕ > 1 (which for a threshold model with T = 2 can be rearranged to z > 1 + 1/ϕ), and taking ϕ ≈ 0.4, we have:\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003z > 1 + 1/0.4 = 1 + 2.5 = 3.5.\\n\\nFor the core of the network, z (the mean core degree) is given by z = p_cc · (N_core – 1). With N_core = 20, this is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003z = p_cc · 19.\\n\\nSetting z = 3.5 gives:\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003p_cc · 19 = 3.5\\u2003\\u2003→\\u2003\\u2003p_cc ≈ 3.5/19 ≈ 0.184.\\n\\nThus, if p_cc exceeds roughly 0.184, or about 18.4% connectivity among core nodes, the mean degree in the core becomes high enough (z > 3.5) for global cascades to become likely when a disruption begins with two failing core nodes. Cascades initiated by failing two random periphery nodes are much less likely to trigger such global effects, given the sparse connectivity among periphery nodes. \\n\\nAssumptions include treating the core as a random graph and using the effective transmission probability ϕ ≈ 0.4, so the estimate is a heuristic guide rather than a precise prediction.A concise validation approach is as follows:\\n\\n1. Generate many realizations of a static core–periphery network with 100 nodes (e.g., 20 core, 80 periphery), setting intra-core link probability (p_cc) to span values around 0.18 (i.e., near the critical value computed from z > 3.5) while keeping p_cp around 0.1–0.3 and p_pp very low.\\n\\n2. Implement the threshold cascade dynamics (threshold = 2) where any node fails once two or more of its neighbors have failed.\\n\\n3. For each network realization, seed the cascade with two failures – one where the initial failures are in the core and one where they are in the periphery.\\n\\n4. Run simulations, recording the final cascade size (e.g., fraction of failed nodes) and the frequency with which a global cascade occurs.\\n\\n5. By plotting the cascade outcome versus p_cc (or the corresponding mean core degree, z = p_cc·(N_core–1)), you should observe a sharp transition in cascade probability near p_cc ≈ 0.184 (corresponding to z ≈ 3.5). This confirms that seeding core nodes is far more effective in triggering cascades when the core connectivity exceeds this threshold.\\n\\nThis simulation-based validation confirms the analytical prediction by showing that global cascades become likely in the parameter regime where the mean core degree exceeds the critical bound derived by (z – 1)·ϕ > 1.A common approach in the literature is to define a “global” or systemic cascade as one in which the cascade reaches a finite (non‐vanishing as N → ∞) fraction of the network. In many studies of threshold cascades on random networks (such as Watts’ work) a global cascade is identified when the cascade size is noticeably larger than typical “local” failures – often using a threshold such as >10–20% of the nodes. However, in some contexts—especially when modeling interbank contagion—the term “systemic failure” is sometimes used more conservatively (e.g., >50% of nodes failing) to indicate near-total system collapse. \\n\\nThus, while there is no single standard, the typical practice is:\\n\\u2003• Define a cascade as “global” if the final fraction of failed nodes is nonzero in the network limit.\\n\\u2003• In finite networks, a practical operational threshold is often set at around 10–20% of nodes failing, but for studies of severe systemic risk, a threshold of 50% is sometimes used.\\n\\nThe exact threshold may vary depending on the study’s focus and the economic interpretation of “systemic,” but the main idea is to distinguish between small, contained cascades and those that propagate widely over the network.A straightforward validation is to build a simulation of the threshold cascade dynamics on a static core–periphery network with, say, 20 core nodes and 80 periphery nodes. Here’s the concise procedure:\\n\\n1. Create many network realizations using the given link probabilities (p_cc for core–core, p_cp for core–periphery, p_pp for periphery–periphery). Vary p_cc across values near the computed critical value (around 0.18, so that the mean core degree z = p_cc·(N_core–1) crosses about 3.5).\\n\\n2. For each generated network, implement the threshold dynamics where each node fails if two or more neighbors have failed. Seed the cascade by failing two randomly chosen nodes—either from the core or the periphery.\\n\\n3. Run the simulation iteratively until no additional failures occur, and record the final cascade size (the fraction of nodes that failed).\\n\\n4. By aggregating results over many runs, plot the probability and average size of cascades versus p_cc (or the corresponding mean core degree). In doing so, you should observe a sharp increase in the cascade size (signifying global or systemic failure) once the mean core degree exceeds the critical threshold.\\n\\nThis simulation–based approach validates the analytical heuristic that a core mean degree (via p_cc) above roughly 3.5 (or p_cc > 0.18 for N_core = 20) is required for global cascades, while also allowing a quantitative check of the relative impact of seeding the cascade in the core versus the periphery.In the threshold cascade literature—especially in studies inspired by Watts’ model and its applications to banking networks—synchronous updating is commonly used. In this approach, all nodes are updated simultaneously at each discrete time step, which aligns well with the “round‐based” nature of these models and makes the analysis more tractable. While some studies consider asynchronous updating for capturing more nuanced dynamics, the standard practice for threshold cascades in core–periphery and interbank contagion contexts remains synchronous updating.Standard practice in threshold cascade studies, including those for core–periphery banking networks, is to use synchronous updating. In other words, at each discrete time step all nodes update their status simultaneously based on the state of their neighbors in the previous step. This \"round-based\" update method is favored because it simplifies analysis and is consistent with seminal works (e.g., the Watts model).\\n\\nTo validate this using an epidemic mechanistic model simulation on a static network, you would:\\n\\n1. Generate a core–periphery network with the prescribed sizes and link probabilities.\\n2. Implement the threshold cascade dynamics (each node fails if ≥2 neighbors have failed) using synchronous updating, so that all nodes update their state simultaneously each round.\\n3. Initiate the cascade by failing selected nodes (e.g., two core or two periphery nodes) and propagate until no further failures occur.\\n4. Compare cascade outcomes (e.g., cascade size and probability) across different network realizations and parameter regimes to verify the predicted critical thresholds and to contrast the impact of seeding the core versus the periphery.\\n\\nThis simulation framework demonstrates the standard synchronous updating methodology while allowing quantitative validation of theoretical predictions regarding systemic risk and cascade propagation in core–periphery networks.The standard practice in synthetic threshold cascade simulations—unless detailed exposure data are available—is to use undirected, unweighted edges. This simplification keeps the focus on the network topology and the cascade dynamics rather than on heterogeneity in exposures. While some studies introduce edge directionality or weights when modeling realistic interbank relationships (and when data permit), most theoretical work on core–periphery contagion uses the simpler undirected, unweighted formulation to facilitate analysis and interpretation.Standard practice in synthetic threshold cascade simulations is to treat network edges as undirected and unweighted when specific exposure data aren’t available. This simplifies the analysis and isolates the effects of network topology on contagion dynamics.\\n\\nTo validate this via an epidemic mechanistic model on a static network, you would:\\n\\n1. Build synthetic core–periphery networks using undirected, unweighted edges with specified sizes and link probabilities.\\n2. Implement synchronous threshold cascade dynamics (each node fails if two or more neighboring nodes have failed).\\n3. Initiate cascades (e.g., by failing two core nodes versus two periphery nodes) and run the simulation until no further failures occur.\\n4. Collect and analyze outcomes (final cascade size and frequency) over many network realizations. Comparisons against theoretical thresholds (e.g., critical mean core degree) help validate that using undirected, unweighted connections is sufficient to capture the essential contagion dynamics in such models.\\n\\nThis framework confirms that—absent detailed data—it is standard and effective to use undirected, unweighted edges in threshold cascade simulations.') \n ======\nNow please create a step by step plan through chain-of-thought ** Focus exclusively on design of the mechanistic model**\nImportant: Your should Solely focus on parametric compartmental model network structure, do not set values for the parameters or initial conditions.", "output": "Certainly!

instead, the model must encode that the transition rule for each node is evaluated on its individual neighborhood in the specified static network.\n- The connectivity structure (core-periphery partition and connection probabilities) is treated as a fixed (frozen) parameter of the model.\n- The model requires as input the adjacency matrix of the network.\n\n### Step 8: Abstract and Generalize for Mechanistic Modeling\n- The compartmental model is rule-based, with:\n  - An absorbing “F” state.\n  - Deterministic, network-dependent threshold transitions.\n  - Structural parameters: network topology (node set, groupings, adjacency matrix).\n  - Dynamic rule: transition occurs for a node if the count of Failed neighbors ≥ threshold.\n\n### Step 9: Prepare the General Model Representation\n- Summarize model design without specific initial conditions or parameter values:\n  - name: “Threshold Cascade on Core-Periphery Network” (TC-CPN)\n  - compartments: [\"N\", \"F\"]\n  - transitions: {\"N -(≥2 F neighbors)-> F\": \"Threshold=2\"}\n  - network structure: static, undirected, unweighted, core-periphery, parametric via (N_core, N_periphery, p_cc, p_cp, p_pp)\n  - synchronous update\n  - simulation proceeds until no more nodes transition (absorbing fixed point)\n\n---\n\n**Reasoning for This Approach:**\n- The design strictly follows the scenario description: threshold-based, strictly non-recovering, network-driven failure.\n- Compartment count and transitions are minimized to represent only the necessary discrete states (Not Failed/Failed).\n- The network structure is embedded as a model parameter, as it crucially modulates the rules for who can transition and when.\n- Synchronous updating ensures that the modeled dynamics accurately reflect the collective, “round-based” cascade characteristics standard in theoretical and empirical literature.\n- This plan yields a concise, widely interpretable class of epidemic analog models suitable for threshold contagion in heterogeneous (core-periphery) networks, without reference to pathogen, infection rates, or population “mixing”.\n\n---\n\nThis stepwise plan provides a bulletproof framework for formalizing the mechanistic compartmental model structure, ready for further analytical or simulation-based exploration.", "error": null, "no_exec_iter": 0, "no_reflections": 0, "meta": {}}

In a core‐periphery network the core forms a relatively “tight‐knit” group of banks (nodes) that are mutually highly connected.

In contrast, if two periphery nodes (which are only loosely connected and get mostly their links to the core) fail, hardly any node receives two “hits” from within a single densely inter‐connected region. In short, a pair of failing core nodes is likely to “push” many of their core neighbors above the fixed threshold of 2 failing neighbors – triggering additional failures (and hence a global cascade) – whereas a similar pair in the periphery very rarely does so.\\n\\nA heuristic derivation of when the cascade “takes off” is possible by approximating the cascade in the core as a kind of branching process. Assume for simplicity that the core may be regarded as a random graph (with a tree–like local structure) having mean degree\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003z ≃ pcc·(Ncore – 1).\\n\\nIn the Threshold Cascade Model with threshold T = 2 a node does not “default” because of a single failed neighbor but will default as soon as it “sees” two or more defaults among its neighbors. Now, imagine that during the cascade each failed node has the potential to “assist” in failing a core neighbor that had already one failed neighbor. In a crude “pair–approximation” one may argue that a necessary condition for the cascade to spread is that on average a failed node “helps” to induce at least one further failure. Let ϕ be an effective probability that, if one neighbor of a typical core node has failed, then that node will eventually “collect” one more failed neighbor from the remaining z – 1 neighbors. (This ϕ is some effective “transmission” probability that depends on local redundancies, the distribution of degrees, and on the fact that nodes are only affected when two neighbors collapse.) Then one expects that the branching process will be super–critical if\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003(z – 1)·ϕ > 1.\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003(1)\\n\\nIf we interpret (z – 1)·ϕ as an effective “reproduction number” then this inequality tells us that the cascade will “blow–up” if the (mean) core connectivity is high enough that a node which is “nearly” failing (i.e. having one defaulted neighbor already) is likely (with probability at least 1/(z – 1)) to see one more failure. In many analyses of global cascades (for example in the Watts threshold model) one finds that cascades occur most readily in “intermediate” connectivity regimes – here, because in the core the threshold is absolute (two failures) rather than a fraction, a crude bound is that the core cascade becomes possible when\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003z ≳ 1 + 1/ϕ.\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003(2)\\n\\nWhile the effective parameter ϕ will depend on many details (for instance, the fact that failures tend to “cluster”, the extra connectivity coming from periphery‐core ties, finite–size effects, etc.), it is reasonable as a rough “back–of–the–envelope” estimate that if the mean core degree is on the order of, say, 3–4 or higher then a double‐hit in the core is much more likely to “propagate”. In contrast, a similar double–hit in the periphery does not “collect” enough further exposures because periphery nodes are only loosely interconnected and rarely share two neighbors.\\n\\nLet us now catalog the main points, assumptions, and limitations:\\n\\n1. Qualitative Comparison:\\n\\u2003• Two initially failing core nodes are much more likely to “infect” many other nodes because the core is densely interconnected. In contrast, two failing periphery nodes are unlikely to together “push” any node (especially core nodes) past the threshold.\\n\\u2003• Thus, we expect that an initial failure in the core has a much higher probability of triggering a global cascade (i.e. a large fraction of failures) than an identical seeding in the periphery.\\n\\n2. A Heuristic Cascade Criterion:\\n\\u2003• In the core, if we denote the effective mean degree by z = pcc·(Ncore – 1) and assume that once one neighbor fails a further failure gets transmitted with an effective probability ϕ, then a cascade (“branching process”) is super–critical when\\n\\u2003\\u2003(z – 1)·ϕ > 1.\\n\\u2003• Rearranged, this gives a crude bound for the “critical connectivity”:\\n\\u2003\\u2003z > 1 + 1/ϕ.\\n\\u2003• Although ϕ is not computed from first principles here, one expects that if ϕ is not extremely small (say, if ϕ is roughly 0.3–0.5), then the “critical” mean degree of the core may be on the order of 3–4 or more. In other words, if pcc (and hence z) is too low, then even a failed pair in the core may not provide enough “joint pressure” to induce many further defaults; but increasing pcc beyond this threshold sharply increases the likelihood of a global cascade.\\n\\n3. Assumptions and Limitations:\\n\\u2003• The derivation assumes that the core may be treated approximately as a homogeneous random (locally tree–like) graph. Real networks may have clustering, degree–degree correlations, and other structures that affect these estimates.\\n\\u2003• We assume that the threshold is absolute (T = 2 failures needed) rather than a fraction of the neighbors failing.\\n\\u2003• The effective “transmission probability” ϕ is a heuristic device which in a more refined analysis would depend on the exact details of the network structure (including the role of the periphery in “coupling” to the core).\\n\\u2003• The derivation neglects finite–size effects and the fact that in an actual cascade the timing and ordering of failures may matter.\\n\\u2003• Finally, our analysis is “mean–field” in spirit and does not capture fluctuations or local structural “bottlenecks” that may hinder (or favor) cascades in specific realizations.\\n\\nIn summary, one expects that “attacking” the system by initially failing 2 core nodes will lead to a higher probability of a global cascade compared to initially failing 2 periphery nodes. A simple, albeit heuristic, cascade condition in the core is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003(z – 1)·ϕ > 1\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003or\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003z > 1 + 1/ϕ.\\n\\nThus, if one estimates that under the conditions of the system ϕ is roughly on the order of 0.3–0.5, then a “critical” mean core degree is roughly 3–4 (i.e. pcc should be such that z = pcc·(Ncore – 1) exceeds this value) for global cascades to become likely. This result should be taken as an approximate guide rather than a precise prediction, due to the many idealizations made in the analysis.We can validate the qualitative and heuristic analysis by “playing out” the cascading‐failure process on a synthetic, static core–periphery network using an epidemic mechanistic model. The basic idea is to simulate the dynamics of the threshold cascade on a network generated with the prescribed structure, then compare the cascade size (or probability) for different initializations.\\n\\nThe steps include:\\n\\n1. Network Generation:\\n\\u2003• Create a network where core nodes (N_core) are connected with a high probability (p_cc), periphery nodes (N_periphery) with a low probability among themselves (p_pp), and with intermediate connections (p_cp) between core and periphery.\\n\\u2003• This yields a heterogeneous topology with a densely connected core and a sparsely connected periphery.\\n\\n2. Cascade Dynamics:\\n\\u2003• Implement the threshold rule: a node fails (or “gets infected”) if two or more of its neighbors have already failed.\\n\\u2003• Run (iterative or synchronous) simulations where at time zero you initialize failures in either:\\n\\u2003\\u2003(a) 2 random core nodes, or \\n\\u2003\\u2003(b) 2 random periphery nodes.\\n\\u2003• Propagate the failures step-by-step until no further nodes meet the failure condition.\\n\\n3. Repetition and Statistics:\\n\\u2003• For each parameter setting (especially varying the mean core degree via p_cc), repeat the experiment many times.\\n\\u2003• Record metrics like the final fraction of failed nodes and the frequency with which a “global” cascade (e.g. a cascade affecting a large portion of the network) occurs.\\n\\u2003• Plot these quantities versus p_cc (or the corresponding mean core degree) to identify the sharply increasing probability of a global cascade near the critical connectivity estimated as around z\\u2009>\\u20091 + 1/ϕ.\\n\\n4. Comparison between Initializations:\\n\\u2003• Compare the results when seeding the cascade with core versus periphery nodes. The expectation is that the core seed triggers larger cascades more reliably because of the higher density and because core nodes share more neighbors.\\n\\nIn summary, by generating the corresponding core–periphery network, enforcing the threshold rule dynamics, and statistically comparing cascade outcomes for different initial conditions and connectivity levels, one can validate the analysis. This simulation approach verifies that:\\n\\u2003– Cascades initiated in the core spread more globally.\\n\\u2003– There is a critical core connectivity (mean degree roughly of order 3–4, depending on effective transmission ϕ) beyond which global cascades become much more likely.\\n\\nAssumptions and limitations of the simulation include keeping the network static, using a simplified absolute threshold, and assuming synchronous (or appropriately timed asynchronous) updates without considering delays or other real-world complexities.Using the heuristic cascade criterion (z – 1)·ϕ > 1 (which for a threshold model with T = 2 can be rearranged to z > 1 + 1/ϕ), and taking ϕ ≈ 0.4, we have:\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003z > 1 + 1/0.4 = 1 + 2.5 = 3.5.\\n\\nFor the core of the network, z (the mean core degree) is given by z = p_cc · (N_core – 1). With N_core = 20, this is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003z = p_cc · 19.\\n\\nSetting z = 3.5 gives:\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003p_cc · 19 = 3.5\\u2003\\u2003→\\u2003\\u2003p_cc ≈ 3.5/19 ≈ 0.184.\\n\\nThus, if p_cc exceeds roughly 0.184, or about 18.4% connectivity among core nodes, the mean degree in the core becomes high enough (z > 3.5) for global cascades to become likely when a disruption begins with two failing core nodes. Cascades initiated by failing two random periphery nodes are much less likely to trigger such global effects, given the sparse connectivity among periphery nodes. \\n\\nAssumptions include treating the core as a random graph and using the effective transmission probability ϕ ≈ 0.4, so the estimate is a heuristic guide rather than a precise prediction.A concise validation approach is as follows:\\n\\n1. Generate many realizations of a static core–periphery network with 100 nodes (e.g., 20 core, 80 periphery), setting intra-core link probability (p_cc) to span values around 0.18 (i.e., near the critical value computed from z > 3.5) while keeping p_cp around 0.1–0.3 and p_pp very low.\\n\\n2. Implement the threshold cascade dynamics (threshold = 2) where any node fails once two or more of its neighbors have failed.\\n\\n3. For each network realization, seed the cascade with two failures – one where the initial failures are in the core and one where they are in the periphery.\\n\\n4. Run simulations, recording the final cascade size (e.g., fraction of failed nodes) and the frequency with which a global cascade occurs.\\n\\n5. By plotting the cascade outcome versus p_cc (or the corresponding mean core degree, z = p_cc·(N_core–1)), you should observe a sharp transition in cascade probability near p_cc ≈ 0.184 (corresponding to z ≈ 3.5). This confirms that seeding core nodes is far more effective in triggering cascades when the core connectivity exceeds this threshold.\\n\\nThis simulation-based validation confirms the analytical prediction by showing that global cascades become likely in the parameter regime where the mean core degree exceeds the critical bound derived by (z – 1)·ϕ > 1.A common approach in the literature is to define a “global” or systemic cascade as one in which the cascade reaches a finite (non‐vanishing as N → ∞) fraction of the network. In many studies of threshold cascades on random networks (such as Watts’ work) a global cascade is identified when the cascade size is noticeably larger than typical “local” failures – often using a threshold such as >10–20% of the nodes. However, in some contexts—especially when modeling interbank contagion—the term “systemic failure” is sometimes used more conservatively (e.g., >50% of nodes failing) to indicate near-total system collapse. \\n\\nThus, while there is no single standard, the typical practice is:\\n\\u2003• Define a cascade as “global” if the final fraction of failed nodes is nonzero in the network limit.\\n\\u2003• In finite networks, a practical operational threshold is often set at around 10–20% of nodes failing, but for studies of severe systemic risk, a threshold of 50% is sometimes used.\\n\\nThe exact threshold may vary depending on the study’s focus and the economic interpretation of “systemic,” but the main idea is to distinguish between small, contained cascades and those that propagate widely over the network.A straightforward validation is to build a simulation of the threshold cascade dynamics on a static core–periphery network with, say, 20 core nodes and 80 periphery nodes. Here’s the concise procedure:\\n\\n1. Create many network realizations using the given link probabilities (p_cc for core–core, p_cp for core–periphery, p_pp for periphery–periphery). Vary p_cc across values near the computed critical value (around 0.18, so that the mean core degree z = p_cc·(N_core–1) crosses about 3.5).\\n\\n2. For each generated network, implement the threshold dynamics where each node fails if two or more neighbors have failed. Seed the cascade by failing two randomly chosen nodes—either from the core or the periphery.\\n\\n3. Run the simulation iteratively until no additional failures occur, and record the final cascade size (the fraction of nodes that failed).\\n\\n4. By aggregating results over many runs, plot the probability and average size of cascades versus p_cc (or the corresponding mean core degree). In doing so, you should observe a sharp increase in the cascade size (signifying global or systemic failure) once the mean core degree exceeds the critical threshold.\\n\\nThis simulation–based approach validates the analytical heuristic that a core mean degree (via p_cc) above roughly 3.5 (or p_cc > 0.18 for N_core = 20) is required for global cascades, while also allowing a quantitative check of the relative impact of seeding the cascade in the core versus the periphery.In the threshold cascade literature—especially in studies inspired by Watts’ model and its applications to banking networks—synchronous updating is commonly used. In this approach, all nodes are updated simultaneously at each discrete time step, which aligns well with the “round‐based” nature of these models and makes the analysis more tractable. While some studies consider asynchronous updating for capturing more nuanced dynamics, the standard practice for threshold cascades in core–periphery and interbank contagion contexts remains synchronous updating.Standard practice in threshold cascade studies, including those for core–periphery banking networks, is to use synchronous updating. In other words, at each discrete time step all nodes update their status simultaneously based on the state of their neighbors in the previous step. This \"round-based\" update method is favored because it simplifies analysis and is consistent with seminal works (e.g., the Watts model).\\n\\nTo validate this using an epidemic mechanistic model simulation on a static network, you would:\\n\\n1. Generate a core–periphery network with the prescribed sizes and link probabilities.\\n2. Implement the threshold cascade dynamics (each node fails if ≥2 neighbors have failed) using synchronous updating, so that all nodes update their state simultaneously each round.\\n3. Initiate the cascade by failing selected nodes (e.g., two core or two periphery nodes) and propagate until no further failures occur.\\n4. Compare cascade outcomes (e.g., cascade size and probability) across different network realizations and parameter regimes to verify the predicted critical thresholds and to contrast the impact of seeding the core versus the periphery.\\n\\nThis simulation framework demonstrates the standard synchronous updating methodology while allowing quantitative validation of theoretical predictions regarding systemic risk and cascade propagation in core–periphery networks.The standard practice in synthetic threshold cascade simulations—unless detailed exposure data are available—is to use undirected, unweighted edges. This simplification keeps the focus on the network topology and the cascade dynamics rather than on heterogeneity in exposures. While some studies introduce edge directionality or weights when modeling realistic interbank relationships (and when data permit), most theoretical work on core–periphery contagion uses the simpler undirected, unweighted formulation to facilitate analysis and interpretation.Standard practice in synthetic threshold cascade simulations is to treat network edges as undirected and unweighted when specific exposure data aren’t available. This simplifies the analysis and isolates the effects of network topology on contagion dynamics.\\n\\nTo validate this via an epidemic mechanistic model on a static network, you would:\\n\\n1. Build synthetic core–periphery networks using undirected, unweighted edges with specified sizes and link probabilities.\\n2. Implement synchronous threshold cascade dynamics (each node fails if two or more neighboring nodes have failed).\\n3. Initiate cascades (e.g., by failing two core nodes versus two periphery nodes) and run the simulation until no further failures occur.\\n4. Collect and analyze outcomes (final cascade size and frequency) over many network realizations. Comparisons against theoretical thresholds (e.g., critical mean core degree) help validate that using undirected, unweighted connections is sufficient to capture the essential contagion dynamics in such models.\\n\\nThis framework confirms that—absent detailed data—it is standard and effective to use undirected, unweighted edges in threshold cascade simulations.') \n ======\nPlease through  chain of thoughts set up an epidemic mechanistic (compartmental) model for the scenario.\n\nImportant: Your should Solely focus on parametric compartmental model network structure, do not set values for the parameters or initial conditions.Certainly! Here’s a detailed step-by-step plan, using chain-of-thought reasoning, focused exclusively on the design of the mechanistic (compartmental) model and the associated network structure—without specifying values for model parameters, initial conditions, or simulation procedures.\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-Step Chain-of-Thought Plan for Mechanistic Model Design\n\n### Step 1: Define the State Space (Compartments)\n- Identify the discrete states that any given bank (node) can occupy.\n- The scenario describes banks as being either “Not Failed” (operational) or “Failed” (defaulted, insolvent).\n- Thus, assign two compartments: “Not Failed (N)” and “Failed (F)”.\n\n### Step 2: Establish the Core Transition Mechanism\n- The sole transition is from “Not Failed” to “Failed,” based on a threshold mechanism.\n- The transition for a node occurs if ≥2 neighboring nodes are already in the “Failed” state.\n- Once Failed, nodes do not recover—this is a monotonic (absorbing state) process.\n\n### Step 3: Specify the Transition Rule in Compartmental Notation\n- Since the process proceeds via synchronous updating on a static network, formalize the transition as:\n  - N -(≥2 F neighbors)-> F\n- There is no transition from F back to N (no recovery), reflecting cascade/contagion irreversibility.\n- This is not a rate-based but a discrete event-driven (rule-based) transition, parametrized by a threshold (here, threshold = 2).\n\n### Step 4: Incorporate the Network Structure into the Model\n- Recognize that transitions are not homogeneous or mean-field, but depend on local network topology.\n- The network is a static, undirected, unweighted core-periphery graph:\n  - Nodes split into “Core” and “Periphery” groups.\n  - Edges between nodes represent interbank links, with connection probabilities depending on group memberships:\n    - Core-Core: high connection probability (p_cc)\n    - Core-Periphery: moderate probability (p_cp)\n    - Periphery-Periphery: low probability (p_pp)\n- The threshold rule operates on each node’s neighborhood as defined by this network.\n\n### Step 5: Articulate the Model Name and Key Features\n- This is a deterministic, synchronous updating, threshold-based contagion model on a heterogeneous (core-periphery) network.\n- The proper name: “Threshold Cascade on Core-Periphery Network” (abbreviated as TC-CPN, or similar), analogous to an SI model but with a threshold rule.\n\n### Step 6: Enumerate and Abstract Model Compartments and Transitions\n- Define formal compartment list:\n  - [\"N\" (Not Failed), \"F\" (Failed)]\n- Define transitions as:\n  - {\"N -(≥2 F neighbors)-> F\": \"Threshold=2\"}\n    - The parameter for the transition is the “neighbor failure threshold,” not a traditional rate.\n- Specify that all transitions are evaluated in parallel at each discrete time step (synchronous rounds).\n\n### Step 7: Encode Network-Dependence into the Model Structure\n- Transitions cannot be written as mean-field ODEs; instead, the model must encode that the transition rule for each node is evaluated on its individual neighborhood in the specified static network.\n- The connectivity structure (core-periphery partition and connection probabilities) is treated as a fixed (frozen) parameter of the model.\n- The model requires as input the adjacency matrix of the network.\n\n### Step 8: Abstract and Generalize for Mechanistic Modeling\n- The compartmental model is rule-based, with:\n  - An absorbing “F” state.\n  - Deterministic, network-dependent threshold transitions.\n  - Structural parameters: network topology (node set, groupings, adjacency matrix).\n  - Dynamic rule: transition occurs for a node if the count of Failed neighbors ≥ threshold.\n\n### Step 9: Prepare the General Model Representation\n- Summarize model design without specific initial conditions or parameter values:\n  - name: “Threshold Cascade on Core-Periphery Network” (TC-CPN)\n  - compartments: [\"N\", \"F\"]\n  - transitions: {\"N -(≥2 F neighbors)-> F\": \"Threshold=2\"}\n  - network structure: static, undirected, unweighted, core-periphery, parametric via (N_core, N_periphery, p_cc, p_cp, p_pp)\n  - synchronous update\n  - simulation proceeds until no more nodes transition (absorbing fixed point)\n\n---\n\n**Reasoning for This Approach:**\n- The design strictly follows the scenario description: threshold-based, strictly non-recovering, network-driven failure.\n- Compartment count and transitions are minimized to represent only the necessary discrete states (Not Failed/Failed).\n- The network structure is embedded as a model parameter, as it crucially modulates the rules for who can transition and when.\n- Synchronous updating ensures that the modeled dynamics accurately reflect the collective, “round-based” cascade characteristics standard in theoretical and empirical literature.\n- This plan yields a concise, widely interpretable class of epidemic analog models suitable for threshold contagion in heterogeneous (core-periphery) networks, without reference to pathogen, infection rates, or population “mixing”.\n\n---\n\nThis stepwise plan provides a bulletproof framework for formalizing the mechanistic compartmental model structure, ready for further analytical or simulation-based exploration.", "output": {"name": "Threshold Cascade on Core-Periphery Network (TC-CPN)", "compartments": ["N", "F"], "transitions": {"N -(≥2 F neighbors)-> F": "Threshold=2"}, "reasoning_info": "Chain-of-thought reasoning for model structure:\n1.

Edges represent interbank exposures and are undirected and unweighted—per conventional synthetic modeling. The network is generated such that core nodes are densely interconnected (intra-core connection probability p_cc, typically 0.5–1.0), core-periphery connections are moderately dense (p_cp, typically 0.1–0.3), and periphery-periphery connections are very sparse (p_pp, typically 0.01–0.05). The cascade (failure) dynamics follows a threshold rule: any bank (node) fails if two or more of its neighbors have failed (Threshold = 2). The model uses synchronous updating, meaning all banks update their status at each time step based on the prior round (standard in threshold models). Two initial shock scenarios are tested: (a) two random core nodes are failed at t=0, and (b) two random periphery nodes are failed at t=0. The simulation runs until no further failures occur (fixed point). Systemic/global failure is defined as >20% of nodes failing, consistent with standard theoretical practice distinguishing local versus truly systemic cascades. The effect of increasing core connectivity (p_cc, and thus the core mean degree z) is measured on the likelihood of systemic failure triggered from the two distinct initial conditions. A key analytical result is the critical mean core degree z_crit ≈ 3.5 (for threshold=2, and effective ϕ≈0.4): i.e., p_cc_crit ≈ 0.18 for a 20-core network.

In a core‐periphery network the core forms a relatively “tight‐knit” group of banks (nodes) that are mutually highly connected.

In contrast, if two periphery nodes (which are only loosely connected and get mostly their links to the core) fail, hardly any node receives two “hits” from within a single densely inter‐connected region. In short, a pair of failing core nodes is likely to “push” many of their core neighbors above the fixed threshold of 2 failing neighbors – triggering additional failures (and hence a global cascade) – whereas a similar pair in the periphery very rarely does so.\\n\\nA heuristic derivation of when the cascade “takes off” is possible by approximating the cascade in the core as a kind of branching process. Assume for simplicity that the core may be regarded as a random graph (with a tree–like local structure) having mean degree\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003z ≃ pcc·(Ncore – 1).\\n\\nIn the Threshold Cascade Model with threshold T = 2 a node does not “default” because of a single failed neighbor but will default as soon as it “sees” two or more defaults among its neighbors. Now, imagine that during the cascade each failed node has the potential to “assist” in failing a core neighbor that had already one failed neighbor. In a crude “pair–approximation” one may argue that a necessary condition for the cascade to spread is that on average a failed node “helps” to induce at least one further failure. Let ϕ be an effective probability that, if one neighbor of a typical core node has failed, then that node will eventually “collect” one more failed neighbor from the remaining z – 1 neighbors. (This ϕ is some effective “transmission” probability that depends on local redundancies, the distribution of degrees, and on the fact that nodes are only affected when two neighbors collapse.) Then one expects that the branching process will be super–critical if\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003(z – 1)·ϕ > 1.\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003(1)\\n\\nIf we interpret (z – 1)·ϕ as an effective “reproduction number” then this inequality tells us that the cascade will “blow–up” if the (mean) core connectivity is high enough that a node which is “nearly” failing (i.e. having one defaulted neighbor already) is likely (with probability at least 1/(z – 1)) to see one more failure. In many analyses of global cascades (for example in the Watts threshold model) one finds that cascades occur most readily in “intermediate” connectivity regimes – here, because in the core the threshold is absolute (two failures) rather than a fraction, a crude bound is that the core cascade becomes possible when\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003z ≳ 1 + 1/ϕ.\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003(2)\\n\\nWhile the effective parameter ϕ will depend on many details (for instance, the fact that failures tend to “cluster”, the extra connectivity coming from periphery‐core ties, finite–size effects, etc.), it is reasonable as a rough “back–of–the–envelope” estimate that if the mean core degree is on the order of, say, 3–4 or higher then a double‐hit in the core is much more likely to “propagate”. In contrast, a similar double–hit in the periphery does not “collect” enough further exposures because periphery nodes are only loosely interconnected and rarely share two neighbors.\\n\\nLet us now catalog the main points, assumptions, and limitations:\\n\\n1. Qualitative Comparison:\\n\\u2003• Two initially failing core nodes are much more likely to “infect” many other nodes because the core is densely interconnected. In contrast, two failing periphery nodes are unlikely to together “push” any node (especially core nodes) past the threshold.\\n\\u2003• Thus, we expect that an initial failure in the core has a much higher probability of triggering a global cascade (i.e. a large fraction of failures) than an identical seeding in the periphery.\\n\\n2. A Heuristic Cascade Criterion:\\n\\u2003• In the core, if we denote the effective mean degree by z = pcc·(Ncore – 1) and assume that once one neighbor fails a further failure gets transmitted with an effective probability ϕ, then a cascade (“branching process”) is super–critical when\\n\\u2003\\u2003(z – 1)·ϕ > 1.\\n\\u2003• Rearranged, this gives a crude bound for the “critical connectivity”:\\n\\u2003\\u2003z > 1 + 1/ϕ.\\n\\u2003• Although ϕ is not computed from first principles here, one expects that if ϕ is not extremely small (say, if ϕ is roughly 0.3–0.5), then the “critical” mean degree of the core may be on the order of 3–4 or more. In other words, if pcc (and hence z) is too low, then even a failed pair in the core may not provide enough “joint pressure” to induce many further defaults; but increasing pcc beyond this threshold sharply increases the likelihood of a global cascade.\\n\\n3. Assumptions and Limitations:\\n\\u2003• The derivation assumes that the core may be treated approximately as a homogeneous random (locally tree–like) graph. Real networks may have clustering, degree–degree correlations, and other structures that affect these estimates.\\n\\u2003• We assume that the threshold is absolute (T = 2 failures needed) rather than a fraction of the neighbors failing.\\n\\u2003• The effective “transmission probability” ϕ is a heuristic device which in a more refined analysis would depend on the exact details of the network structure (including the role of the periphery in “coupling” to the core).\\n\\u2003• The derivation neglects finite–size effects and the fact that in an actual cascade the timing and ordering of failures may matter.\\n\\u2003• Finally, our analysis is “mean–field” in spirit and does not capture fluctuations or local structural “bottlenecks” that may hinder (or favor) cascades in specific realizations.\\n\\nIn summary, one expects that “attacking” the system by initially failing 2 core nodes will lead to a higher probability of a global cascade compared to initially failing 2 periphery nodes. A simple, albeit heuristic, cascade condition in the core is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003(z – 1)·ϕ > 1\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003or\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003z > 1 + 1/ϕ.\\n\\nThus, if one estimates that under the conditions of the system ϕ is roughly on the order of 0.3–0.5, then a “critical” mean core degree is roughly 3–4 (i.e. pcc should be such that z = pcc·(Ncore – 1) exceeds this value) for global cascades to become likely. This result should be taken as an approximate guide rather than a precise prediction, due to the many idealizations made in the analysis.We can validate the qualitative and heuristic analysis by “playing out” the cascading‐failure process on a synthetic, static core–periphery network using an epidemic mechanistic model. The basic idea is to simulate the dynamics of the threshold cascade on a network generated with the prescribed structure, then compare the cascade size (or probability) for different initializations.\\n\\nThe steps include:\\n\\n1. Network Generation:\\n\\u2003• Create a network where core nodes (N_core) are connected with a high probability (p_cc), periphery nodes (N_periphery) with a low probability among themselves (p_pp), and with intermediate connections (p_cp) between core and periphery.\\n\\u2003• This yields a heterogeneous topology with a densely connected core and a sparsely connected periphery.\\n\\n2. Cascade Dynamics:\\n\\u2003• Implement the threshold rule: a node fails (or “gets infected”) if two or more of its neighbors have already failed.\\n\\u2003• Run (iterative or synchronous) simulations where at time zero you initialize failures in either:\\n\\u2003\\u2003(a) 2 random core nodes, or \\n\\u2003\\u2003(b) 2 random periphery nodes.\\n\\u2003• Propagate the failures step-by-step until no further nodes meet the failure condition.\\n\\n3. Repetition and Statistics:\\n\\u2003• For each parameter setting (especially varying the mean core degree via p_cc), repeat the experiment many times.\\n\\u2003• Record metrics like the final fraction of failed nodes and the frequency with which a “global” cascade (e.g. a cascade affecting a large portion of the network) occurs.\\n\\u2003• Plot these quantities versus p_cc (or the corresponding mean core degree) to identify the sharply increasing probability of a global cascade near the critical connectivity estimated as around z\\u2009>\\u20091 + 1/ϕ.\\n\\n4. Comparison between Initializations:\\n\\u2003• Compare the results when seeding the cascade with core versus periphery nodes. The expectation is that the core seed triggers larger cascades more reliably because of the higher density and because core nodes share more neighbors.\\n\\nIn summary, by generating the corresponding core–periphery network, enforcing the threshold rule dynamics, and statistically comparing cascade outcomes for different initial conditions and connectivity levels, one can validate the analysis. This simulation approach verifies that:\\n\\u2003– Cascades initiated in the core spread more globally.\\n\\u2003– There is a critical core connectivity (mean degree roughly of order 3–4, depending on effective transmission ϕ) beyond which global cascades become much more likely.\\n\\nAssumptions and limitations of the simulation include keeping the network static, using a simplified absolute threshold, and assuming synchronous (or appropriately timed asynchronous) updates without considering delays or other real-world complexities.Using the heuristic cascade criterion (z – 1)·ϕ > 1 (which for a threshold model with T = 2 can be rearranged to z > 1 + 1/ϕ), and taking ϕ ≈ 0.4, we have:\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003z > 1 + 1/0.4 = 1 + 2.5 = 3.5.\\n\\nFor the core of the network, z (the mean core degree) is given by z = p_cc · (N_core – 1). With N_core = 20, this is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003z = p_cc · 19.\\n\\nSetting z = 3.5 gives:\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003p_cc · 19 = 3.5\\u2003\\u2003→\\u2003\\u2003p_cc ≈ 3.5/19 ≈ 0.184.\\n\\nThus, if p_cc exceeds roughly 0.184, or about 18.4% connectivity among core nodes, the mean degree in the core becomes high enough (z > 3.5) for global cascades to become likely when a disruption begins with two failing core nodes. Cascades initiated by failing two random periphery nodes are much less likely to trigger such global effects, given the sparse connectivity among periphery nodes. \\n\\nAssumptions include treating the core as a random graph and using the effective transmission probability ϕ ≈ 0.4, so the estimate is a heuristic guide rather than a precise prediction.A concise validation approach is as follows:\\n\\n1. Generate many realizations of a static core–periphery network with 100 nodes (e.g., 20 core, 80 periphery), setting intra-core link probability (p_cc) to span values around 0.18 (i.e., near the critical value computed from z > 3.5) while keeping p_cp around 0.1–0.3 and p_pp very low.\\n\\n2. Implement the threshold cascade dynamics (threshold = 2) where any node fails once two or more of its neighbors have failed.\\n\\n3. For each network realization, seed the cascade with two failures – one where the initial failures are in the core and one where they are in the periphery.\\n\\n4. Run simulations, recording the final cascade size (e.g., fraction of failed nodes) and the frequency with which a global cascade occurs.\\n\\n5. By plotting the cascade outcome versus p_cc (or the corresponding mean core degree, z = p_cc·(N_core–1)), you should observe a sharp transition in cascade probability near p_cc ≈ 0.184 (corresponding to z ≈ 3.5). This confirms that seeding core nodes is far more effective in triggering cascades when the core connectivity exceeds this threshold.\\n\\nThis simulation-based validation confirms the analytical prediction by showing that global cascades become likely in the parameter regime where the mean core degree exceeds the critical bound derived by (z – 1)·ϕ > 1.A common approach in the literature is to define a “global” or systemic cascade as one in which the cascade reaches a finite (non‐vanishing as N → ∞) fraction of the network. In many studies of threshold cascades on random networks (such as Watts’ work) a global cascade is identified when the cascade size is noticeably larger than typical “local” failures – often using a threshold such as >10–20% of the nodes. However, in some contexts—especially when modeling interbank contagion—the term “systemic failure” is sometimes used more conservatively (e.g., >50% of nodes failing) to indicate near-total system collapse. \\n\\nThus, while there is no single standard, the typical practice is:\\n\\u2003• Define a cascade as “global” if the final fraction of failed nodes is nonzero in the network limit.\\n\\u2003• In finite networks, a practical operational threshold is often set at around 10–20% of nodes failing, but for studies of severe systemic risk, a threshold of 50% is sometimes used.\\n\\nThe exact threshold may vary depending on the study’s focus and the economic interpretation of “systemic,” but the main idea is to distinguish between small, contained cascades and those that propagate widely over the network.A straightforward validation is to build a simulation of the threshold cascade dynamics on a static core–periphery network with, say, 20 core nodes and 80 periphery nodes. Here’s the concise procedure:\\n\\n1. Create many network realizations using the given link probabilities (p_cc for core–core, p_cp for core–periphery, p_pp for periphery–periphery). Vary p_cc across values near the computed critical value (around 0.18, so that the mean core degree z = p_cc·(N_core–1) crosses about 3.5).\\n\\n2. For each generated network, implement the threshold dynamics where each node fails if two or more neighbors have failed. Seed the cascade by failing two randomly chosen nodes—either from the core or the periphery.\\n\\n3. Run the simulation iteratively until no additional failures occur, and record the final cascade size (the fraction of nodes that failed).\\n\\n4. By aggregating results over many runs, plot the probability and average size of cascades versus p_cc (or the corresponding mean core degree). In doing so, you should observe a sharp increase in the cascade size (signifying global or systemic failure) once the mean core degree exceeds the critical threshold.\\n\\nThis simulation–based approach validates the analytical heuristic that a core mean degree (via p_cc) above roughly 3.5 (or p_cc > 0.18 for N_core = 20) is required for global cascades, while also allowing a quantitative check of the relative impact of seeding the cascade in the core versus the periphery.In the threshold cascade literature—especially in studies inspired by Watts’ model and its applications to banking networks—synchronous updating is commonly used. In this approach, all nodes are updated simultaneously at each discrete time step, which aligns well with the “round‐based” nature of these models and makes the analysis more tractable. While some studies consider asynchronous updating for capturing more nuanced dynamics, the standard practice for threshold cascades in core–periphery and interbank contagion contexts remains synchronous updating.Standard practice in threshold cascade studies, including those for core–periphery banking networks, is to use synchronous updating. In other words, at each discrete time step all nodes update their status simultaneously based on the state of their neighbors in the previous step. This \"round-based\" update method is favored because it simplifies analysis and is consistent with seminal works (e.g., the Watts model).\\n\\nTo validate this using an epidemic mechanistic model simulation on a static network, you would:\\n\\n1. Generate a core–periphery network with the prescribed sizes and link probabilities.\\n2. Implement the threshold cascade dynamics (each node fails if ≥2 neighbors have failed) using synchronous updating, so that all nodes update their state simultaneously each round.\\n3. Initiate the cascade by failing selected nodes (e.g., two core or two periphery nodes) and propagate until no further failures occur.\\n4. Compare cascade outcomes (e.g., cascade size and probability) across different network realizations and parameter regimes to verify the predicted critical thresholds and to contrast the impact of seeding the core versus the periphery.\\n\\nThis simulation framework demonstrates the standard synchronous updating methodology while allowing quantitative validation of theoretical predictions regarding systemic risk and cascade propagation in core–periphery networks.The standard practice in synthetic threshold cascade simulations—unless detailed exposure data are available—is to use undirected, unweighted edges. This simplification keeps the focus on the network topology and the cascade dynamics rather than on heterogeneity in exposures. While some studies introduce edge directionality or weights when modeling realistic interbank relationships (and when data permit), most theoretical work on core–periphery contagion uses the simpler undirected, unweighted formulation to facilitate analysis and interpretation.Standard practice in synthetic threshold cascade simulations is to treat network edges as undirected and unweighted when specific exposure data aren’t available. This simplifies the analysis and isolates the effects of network topology on contagion dynamics.\\n\\nTo validate this via an epidemic mechanistic model on a static network, you would:\\n\\n1. Build synthetic core–periphery networks using undirected, unweighted edges with specified sizes and link probabilities.\\n2. Implement synchronous threshold cascade dynamics (each node fails if two or more neighboring nodes have failed).\\n3. Initiate cascades (e.g., by failing two core nodes versus two periphery nodes) and run the simulation until no further failures occur.\\n4. Collect and analyze outcomes (final cascade size and frequency) over many network realizations. Comparisons against theoretical thresholds (e.g., critical mean core degree) help validate that using undirected, unweighted connections is sufficient to capture the essential contagion dynamics in such models.\\n\\nThis framework confirms that—absent detailed data—it is standard and effective to use undirected, unweighted edges in threshold cascade simulations.'); if not, provide your reflection and set the revise True\notherwise, if you are satisfied with the result, set the revise_needed=False\n", "output": {"reflection": "The generated mechanistic model (Threshold Cascade on Core-Periphery Network, TC-CPN) precisely reflects the original scenario described in the query.
