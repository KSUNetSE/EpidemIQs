        "answer": "Typical systemic‑risk simulations of interbank networks that adopt a core‑periphery topology use a relatively small, tightly linked core (about 10 %–20 % of all banks, i.e., a size‑ratio \\(N_{c}/N_{p}\\) of roughly 0.1–0.2) and a much larger periphery. The core is modeled as almost fully connected, with a core‑core link density \\(k_{c}\\) in the range 0.8–1.0. Peripheral banks are sparsely linked among themselves, with a periphery‑periphery density \\(k_{p}\\) typically between 0.05 and 0.10. Links between core and peripheral banks are intermediate, usually set to a core‑periphery density \\(k_{cp}\\) of about 0.2–0.4, often chosen as the arithmetic mean of \\(k_{c}\\) and \\(k_{p}\\). These parameter ranges are widely used because they reproduce the empirical stylised facts of real interbank networks while allowing clear exploration of contagion dynamics.",

Since different financial network systems typically have distinct structural characteristics, some studies have empirically analyzed the structural characteristics of interbank networks by utilizing actual interbank data. There have also been studies where the systemic risk has been simulated and analyzed under different network structures, assuming the interbank networks are structured differently. Several empirical studies have demonstrated that interbank networks exhibit",

Achille's heel of core-periphery interbank networks is the possibility of common shocks on core banks, which render such networks highly exposed to the risk of systemic contagion. The consequent policy implications underlie the importance of reducing the chance of common shocks to core banks penalising their holding of overlapping and [...] It is an empirical fact that national banking systems in advanced countries display a high fitness to stylised core-periphery networks. This paper evaluates the exposure to systemic risk of core-periphery interbank networks, focusing on the effects of two financial contagion channels: common exposures and direct balance-sheet default contagion.

    "agent_response": "Reason: The search results provide detailed summary information about typical parameter settings used in systemic risk studies of core-periphery financial banking networks. Key parameters include the size ratio of core to periphery banks, and typical connection densities within core banks, within peripheral banks, and between core and peripheral banks (kc, kp, kcp). This information addresses the user's query regarding typical parameterizations used in simulations and systemic risk studies.\n\nAction: Review the summarized values and details from the search result to formulate a comprehensive and precise response.\n\nObservation: The typical parameterizations found are:\n- Size ratio (Nc/Np): ~0.1 to 0.2 (core is 10-20% of the total banks)\n- Core-core connection density (kc): high, typically between 0.8 and 1.0 (almost fully connected core)\n- Periphery-periphery connection density (kp): low, between 0.05 and 0.10 (sparse connections)\n- Core-periphery connection density (kcp): intermediate, about 0.2 to 0.4, often arithmetic mean of kc and kp\nThese reflect empirical stylized facts of real interbank networks and are standard in systemic risk simulation studies of core-periphery structures.\n\nFinal Thought: With these values and their typical ranges, supported by literature and empirical studies, I can now generate the final comprehensive answer.\n\nFinal Answer: \n\nIn systemic risk simulations of core-periphery financial banking networks, the typical parameterizations to represent realistic and empirically observed interbank structures are as follows:\n\n1. Core-Periphery Size Ratio (Nc/Np):  \n   The core group usually comprises about 10% to 20% of all banks in the network, meaning the size ratio between the core (Nc) and periphery (Np) is roughly 0.1 to 0.2.\n\n2. Connection Densities:  \n   - Core-to-Core Density (kc): The core banks form a tightly interconnected group, often modeled as almost fully connected, with link densities typically ranging from 0.8 to 1.0. This reflects strong connectivity among core banks, key for liquidity and risk transmission in the core.  \n   - Periphery-to-Periphery Density (kp): Peripheral banks tend to have sparse interconnections among themselves, with link densities generally between 0.05 and 0.10. This lower density captures the less frequent direct linkage between peripheral nodes.  \n   - Core-to-Periphery Density (kcp): The connection density between core and peripheral banks is generally intermediate, about 0.2 to 0.4, often taken as roughly the arithmetic mean of kc and kp. This parameter controls the extent of linkage and contagion potential between core and peripheral nodes.\n\nThese parameter ranges are widely adopted in systemic risk studies because they reproduce key stylized facts of real interbank networks and allow researchers to examine contagion dynamics and systemic vulnerability in a structured way. Using these defaults helps standardize simulations and enables comparability and robustness of systemic risk results in core-periphery financial network studies."
