We find analytical results determining extinction, mutual exclusion, and coexistence of the viruses by introducing the concepts of survival threshold and winning threshold. Furthermore, we show the possibility of coexistence in SIS-type competitive spreading over multilayer networks. Not only do we rigorously prove a region of coexistence, we quantitate it via interrelation of central nodes across the network layers. Little to no overlapping of layers central nodes is the key determinant of coexistence. Specifically, we show coexistence is impossible if network layers are identical yet possible if the network layers have distinct dominant eigenvectors and node degree vectors. For example, we show both analytically and numerically that positive correlation of network layers makes it difficult for a virus to survive while in a network with negatively correlated layers survival is easier but total removal of the other virus is more difficult. We believe our methodology has great potentials for application to broader classes of multi-pathogen spreading over multi-layer and interconnected networks.",

Competitive exclusion principle is the main principle that governs causative agentries of diseases competition. Identifying coexistence mechanisms is a core issue for studying the interactions of multi-strains. In this paper, we are concerned with the dynamics of a two-strain SIS epidemic model with general incidence rate on complex networks. We derive the basic reproduction numbers and the invasion reproduction numbers associated with each strain, which determine the competitive, exclusion and coexistence of the two strains. We strictly prove that the competitive exclusion principle holds in a global sense and the endemic equilibrium coexists uniquely and globally. Numerical examples visibly illustrate the evolution of the two strains.",

                    "abstract": "Explosive synchronization represents an abrupt first-order transition to coherence in coupled dynamical systems, with significant implications for real-world networks such as neural systems, power grids, and social networks. In this study, we investigate explosive synchronization in adaptive multiplex networks of an arbitrary number of layers with the coexistence of competitive and cooperative interlayer interactions, where the dynamics of a node in one layer is influenced by the coherence of its counterparts in other layers. In addition to these interlayer interactions, our model incorporates interlayer adaptive coupling that can be simultaneously cooperative and competitive. Using a generalized framework, we show that the fraction of competitive nodes fl within each layer critically impacts the synchronization dynamics. Higher fractions suppress synchronization, while lower fractions promote the degree of synchronization transition. As the number of layers increases, the hysteretic behavior associated with explosive synchronization becomes more pronounced, highlighting enhanced resilience in synchronization transitions. The analytical predictions derived from the mean-field approach align closely with the numerical simulations across networks with an arbitrary number of layers, validating the robustness of the proposed framework. This scalability across multiplex networks underscores the critical role of adaptive interdependencies in shaping synchronization patterns. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of how multiplex architectures govern the dynamics of explosive synchronization and provide insight into controlling synchronization in complex systems.",

                    "abstract": "This paper studies the endemic behavior of a multi-competitive networked susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model. Specifically, the paper deals with three competing virus systems (i.e., tri-virus systems). First, we show that a tri-virus system, unlike a bi-virus system, is not a monotone dynamical system. Using the Parametric Transversality Theorem, we show that, generically, a tri-virus system has a finite number of equilibria and that the Jacobian matrices associated with each equilibrium are nonsingular. The endemic equilibria of this system can be classified as follows: a) single-virus endemic equilibria (also referred to as the boundary equilibria), where precisely one of the three viruses is alive; b) 2-coexistence equilibria, where exactly two of the three viruses are alive; and c) 3-coexistence equilibria, where all three viruses survive in the network. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition that guarantees local exponential convergence to a boundary equilibrium. Further, we secure conditions for the nonexistence of 3-coexistence equilibria (resp. for various forms of 2-coexistence equilibria). We also identify sufficient conditions for the existence of a 2-coexistence (resp. 3-coexistence) equilibrium. We identify conditions on the model parameters that give rise to a continuum of coexistence equilibria. More specifically, we establish i) a scenario that admits the existence and local exponential attractivity of a line of coexistence equilibria; and ii) scenarios that admit the existence of, and, in the case of one such scenario, global convergence to, a plane of 3-coexistence equilibria.",

More specifically, we suppose that virus 1 and virus 2 are circulating in the population and are in competition with each other. We show that the model is strongly monotone, and that, under certain assumptions, it does not admit any periodic orbit. We identify a sufficient condition for exponential convergence to the disease-free equilibrium (DFE). Assuming only virus 1 (resp. virus 2) is alive, we establish a condition for global asymptotic convergence to the single-virus endemic equilibrium of virus 1 (resp. virus 2) - our proof does not rely on the construction of a Lyapunov function. Assuming both virus 1 and virus 2 are alive, we establish a condition which ensures local exponential convergence to the single-virus equilibrium of virus 1 (resp. virus 2). Finally, we provide a sufficient (resp. necessary) condition for the existence of a coexistence equilibrium.",

We study the competitive networked bivirus susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on a hypergraph introduced in Cui et al. [1]. We show that the system has, in a generic sense, a finite number of equilibria, and the Jacobian associated with each equilibrium point is nonsingular; the key tool is the Parametric Transver-sality Theorem of differential topology. Since the system is also monotone, it turns out that the typical behavior of the system is convergence to some equilibrium point. Thereafter, we exhibit a tri-stable domain with three locally exponentially stable equilibria. For different parameter regimes, we establish conditions for the existence of a coexistence equilibrium (both viruses infect separate fractions of each population node).",
