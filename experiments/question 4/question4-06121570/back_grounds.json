                    "abstract": "Modeling and control of epidemic-like spreading processes, such as contagions, rumors or products in complex networks, holds profound significance for understanding transmission mechanisms, formulating effective prevention and optimizing resource allocation. This paper investigates the optimal control problems for competing processes modeled by fractional-order bi-virus systems with memory in complex networks for the first time. The proposed model performs exceptionally well in capturing the dynamics of virus transmission and immune. First, the key indicators: bi-basic reproduction numbers (BBRNs) are introduced for the metapopulation model with nonlinear infectious functions in heterogenous networks. Then they are utilized to classify the equilibria, including extinction, absolute dominance and coexistence ones. Second, sufficient conditions for the stability of the equilibria are derived. Leveraging this result, an optimal therapeutic protocol is presented to eradicate viruses and minimize the cost function simultaneously. The corresponding optimal control solutions are generated via gradient descent algorithm, which can converge relatively quickly by iteratively adjusting control variables. Particularly, the role of fractional-order $\\alpha$ in system modeling and optimization is deeply probed into. Finally, numerical examples are also included at the end of this paper to further shed light on the effectiveness of our results.",

                    "abstract": "We study convergence properties of competing epidemic models of the Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible ( $SIS$ ) type. The SIS epidemic model has seen widespread popularity in modelling the spreading dynamics of contagions such as viruses, infectious diseases, or even rumors/opinions over contact networks (graphs). We analyze the case of two such viruses spreading on overlaid graphs, with non-linear rates of infection spread and recovery. We call this the non-linear bi-virus model and, building upon recent results, obtain precise conditions for global convergence of the solutions to a trichotomy of possible outcomes: a virus-free state, a single-virus state, and to a coexistence state. Our techniques are based on the theory of monotone dynamical systems (MDS), in contrast to Lyapunov based techniques that have only seen partial success in determining convergence properties in the setting of competing epidemics. We demonstrate how the existing works have been unsuccessful in characterizing a large subset of the model parameter space for bi-virus epidemics, including all scenarios leading to coexistence of the epidemics. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first in providing complete convergence analysis for the bi-virus system with non-linear infection and recovery rates on general graphs.",

We find analytical expressions determining extinction, coexistence, and absolute dominance of the viruses after we introduce the concepts of survival threshold and absolute-dominance threshold. The main outcome of our analysis is the discovery and proof of a region for long-term coexistence of competitive viruses in nontrivial multilayer networks. We show coexistence is impossible if network layers are identical yet possible if network layers are distinct. Not only do we rigorously prove a region of coexistence, but we can quantitate it via interrelation of central nodes across the network layers. Little to no overlapping of the layers' central nodes is the key determinant of coexistence. For example, we show both analytically and numerically that positive correlation of network layers makes it difficult for a virus to survive, while in a network with negatively correlated layers, survival is easier, but total removal of the other virus is more difficult.",

When it comes to competition between two such contagions spreading on overlaid graphs, their propagation is captured by so-called bi-virus epidemic models. Analysis of such dynamical systems involve the identification of equilibrium points and its convergence properties, which determine whether either of the viruses dies out, or both survive together. We demonstrate how the existing works are unsuccessful in characterizing a large subset of the model parameter space, including all parameters for which the competitiveness of the bi-virus system is significant enough to attain coexistence of the epidemics.

The networked dynamics can give rise to complex equilibria patterns, and most current results identify conditions on the model parameters for convergence to the healthy equilibrium (where both viruses are extinct) or a boundary equilibrium (where one virus is endemic and the other is extinct). However, there are only limited results on coexistence equilibria (where both viruses are endemic). This paper establishes a set of ``counting'' results which provide lower bounds on the number of coexistence equilibria, and perhaps more importantly, establish properties on the local stability/instability properties of these equilibria. In order to do this, we employ the Poincar\\'e-Hopf Theorem but with significant modifications to overcome several challenges arising from the bivirus system model, such as the fact that the system dynamics do not evolve on a manifold in the typical sense required to apply Poincar\\'e-Hopf Theory. Subsequently, Morse inequalities are used to tighten the counting results, under the reasonable assumption that the bivirus system is a Morse-Smale dynamical system. Numerical examples are provided which demonstrate the presence of multiple attractor equilibria, and multiple coexistence equilibria.",

Yet generally, the virus may evolve due to the influence of environments and medical interventions, or the information may be modified by individuals in networks. In this letter, we investigate the spread of two competing viruses in a network, where one of the viruses can mutate into the other one with a certain probability. Based on the multi-group susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model, a mathematical model is proposed to describe the spread of viruses with mutations. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the zero equilibrium, and the conditions for the existence, uniqueness, and local exponential stability of the coexisting equilibrium. Our results demonstrate that the mutation can affect the spreading ability of the virus and the coexistence of viruses. Moreover, we show the effect of mutation on the proportion of infected individuals by comparing it with the model without mutation.",
