### Reasoning & Logic: Multiplex Network Construction for Competing SIS Model

1. **Node Set & Population Size:** 
   - Both layers constructed with N=1000 nodes, representing identical individuals for valid infection competition.
2. **Layer Types:**
   - Layer A: Barabási-Albert (BA, scale-free; m=4 to target <k>=8).
   - Layer B: Erdős-Rényi (ER, p ≈ 0.006 to target <k>=6).
   - This mimics real scenarios (social contacts—BA—vs. random spread—ER), spectral radii reflect contrasting degree heterogeneity.
3. **Overlap:**
   - 10% of Layer B’s edges are taken directly from Layer A edges, specifically to tune overlap as a key coexistence driver.
   - Rest of B’s edges independent, minimizing additional correlation.
4. **Degree Correlation/Alignment:**
   - No node-degree targeting for positive correlation; edges in B added independently, inter-layer eigenvector alignment is negative (rho ≈ -0.69), enforcing structural independence and maximizing coexistence regime.
5. **Validation and Features:**
   - Layer A: <k> = 7.97, <k²> = 138.02, λ₁(A)=17.33
   - Layer B: <k> = 6.00, <k²>=41.66, λ₁(B)=7.10
   - Overlap = 10%.  Cosine similarity between leading eigenvectors is negative, so degree central nodes in A tend not to be central in B (as designed).
6. **Output:**
   - Each layer saved as a separate sparse adjacency matrix for mechanistic SIS simulations. Plots illustrate degree distributions, interlayer degree correlation, and spectral density for transparent validation.
   - Design emphasizes separation of high-influence nodes and edge sets, thus structurally maximizing conditions for coexistence described in the analytical solution.

Two-layer multiplex contact network constructed for simulation of competing exclusive SIS epidemics:

- Layer A (BA): N=1000 nodes, scale-free structure, m=4, mean degree = 7.97, second degree moment = 138.02, spectral radius λ₁ = 17.33.
- Layer B (ER): N=1000 nodes, mean degree = 6.00, second degree moment = 41.66, spectral radius λ₁ = 7.10.
- Edge overlap: 10% of Layer B’s edges also present in A.
- Interlayer eigenvector alignment (ρ): -0.69 (central nodes differ between layers, minimal degree correlation).
- Centralities: Both layers visualized (see plots); structure supports competitive/exclusive dynamics with maximal coexistence regime as per theory.
