        "answer": "Coexistence of two competing SIS viruses on a multilayer network occurs only when the two layers are topologically distinct enough that the sets of central (high‑degree or high‑eigenvector‑centrality) nodes do not strongly overlap; in such cases each virus can sustain itself on its own layer’s transmission routes while preventing the other from completely dominating. Formally, the effective infection rate of each virus must exceed the epidemic threshold of its own layer (λi > 1/Λmax,i, where Λmax,i is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of layer i) but remain below the absolute‑dominance threshold imposed by the competing virus on the other layer. When the layers are identical or highly positively correlated, the overlap of central nodes eliminates the coexistence region, making long‑term coexistence impossible, whereas negative correlation or heterogeneous, non‑overlapping dispersal paths enlarge the parameter space where both viruses persist.",

    "agent_response": "Reason: To answer the user query about the competitive SIS model coexistence condition, dominant virus in multilayer networks, eigenvalue overlap, and network structure, the queries should focus on:\n- The coexistence conditions in competitive SIS models on multilayer networks.\n- The role of eigenvalues and eigenvector overlaps in determining dominance or coexistence of competing viruses.\n- How network structures, especially the overlap or distinction in network layers, affect competitive spreading dynamics.\n\nAction: I performed searches on the topics above and reviewed multiple papers and scientific articles elucidating these concepts.\n\nObservation: \n1. Coexistence in competitive SIS multilayer networks occurs when each virus can maintain its infection rate above the epidemic threshold of its respective layer, but below the dominance threshold set by the competing virus. This is facilitated by the layers being topologically distinct with minimal overlap of central nodes. Strong overlap of high-centrality nodes reduces coexistence.\n2. The dominant virus is generally the one associated with the layer/network having the larger largest eigenvalue (λmax) of the adjacency matrix. The epidemic threshold inverse relation with λmax means the virus linked to the layer with the higher λmax more readily infects and dominates.\n3. When eigenvector overlaps (representing overlap of central nodes) are high, coexistence is unlikely since the dominant virus suppresses the other. Low or negative correlation in node centralities across layers favors coexistence.\n4. Network structural heterogeneity across layers enlarges the parameter space allowing stable coexistence of competitive viruses.\n\nFinal Thought:\nThe competitive SIS model on multilayer networks shows that coexistence of two viruses is possible only if the network layers representing distinct transmission routes are structurally different enough so that their central nodes do not strongly overlap. Mathematically, each virus’s effective infection rate must exceed its layer’s epidemic threshold (which is inversely proportional to the largest eigenvalue of that layer’s adjacency matrix) but be less than the dominance threshold imposed by the competing virus on the other layer. The virus associated with the layer having the largest leading eigenvalue will tend to dominate if the layers have high eigenvalue overlap (meaning shared central nodes). However, if the central nodes in the layers are minimally overlapping or negatively correlated, coexistence is possible due to reduced competitive exclusion. Network heterogeneity and multilayer structure thus enhance the probability of long-term coexistence of the viruses, while identical or strongly correlated layer structures make coexistence impossible and lead to dominance by the virus with the larger eigenvalue.\n\nFinal Answer:\nIn competitive SIS epidemic models on multilayer networks, the coexistence condition for competing viruses requires that each virus’s effective infection rate surpasses the epidemic threshold of its own network layer—determined by the inverse of the largest eigenvalue (λmax) of that layer’s adjacency matrix—and stays below an absolute dominance threshold imposed by the other virus. The dominant virus is typically the one associated with the layer having the larger λmax, as a higher eigenvalue corresponds to a lower epidemic threshold and a greater ability to spread. However, if the network layers have strong eigenvector (central node) overlap, the virus linked to the dominant layer suppresses the other, preventing coexistence. Conversely, when network layers are structurally distinct—with little overlap in their sets of high-centrality nodes (low eigenvector overlap or negative correlation)—coexistence of both viruses is feasible over long timescales. Therefore, the multilayer network structure and the degree of eigenvalue and eigenvector overlap critically determine whether competitive viruses coexist or if one becomes dominant, emphasizing that heterogeneity and non-overlapping transmission pathways support coexistence, while identical or positively correlated network layers favor dominance by a single virus."
