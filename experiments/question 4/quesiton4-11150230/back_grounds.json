                    "abstract": "Explosive synchronization represents an abrupt first-order transition to coherence in coupled dynamical systems, with significant implications for real-world networks such as neural systems, power grids, and social networks. In this study, we investigate explosive synchronization in adaptive multiplex networks of an arbitrary number of layers with the coexistence of competitive and cooperative interlayer interactions, where the dynamics of a node in one layer is influenced by the coherence of its counterparts in other layers. In addition to these interlayer interactions, our model incorporates interlayer adaptive coupling that can be simultaneously cooperative and competitive. Using a generalized framework, we show that the fraction of competitive nodes fl within each layer critically impacts the synchronization dynamics. Higher fractions suppress synchronization, while lower fractions promote the degree of synchronization transition. As the number of layers increases, the hysteretic behavior associated with explosive synchronization becomes more pronounced, highlighting enhanced resilience in synchronization transitions. The analytical predictions derived from the mean-field approach align closely with the numerical simulations across networks with an arbitrary number of layers, validating the robustness of the proposed framework. This scalability across multiplex networks underscores the critical role of adaptive interdependencies in shaping synchronization patterns. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of how multiplex architectures govern the dynamics of explosive synchronization and provide insight into controlling synchronization in complex systems.",

The double-layer multiplex networks are adopted to depict the coupled dynamics of the resource allocation and epidemic spreading, and a coupled model based on the modified SIS model is proposed. Through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we find that on a network without inter-layer degree correlation, there is a cross point of the basic infection rate, when the value of the basic infection rate is lower than the cross point, the breakout of the epidemic can be postponed with the decrease of the level of awareness, while when it is larger than the point, the spread size of the epidemic can be reduced with the increase of the level of awareness. In addition, we also find that the inter-layer degree correlation can reduce the final spread size of the epidemic.",

Here we aimed to assess the association between coexistence and morphology of cave bats in Cuba and differences in morphologic and dietary aspects. We assembled lists of species from 108 localities with at least three co\u2013inhabiting species. Fourteen species of bats in at least three localities were included. Based on the literature we also obtained the mean values of five morphological variables and the basic composition of diet. We calculated coexistence patterns using EcoSim v7.72 based on the average number of checkerboard units that appeared between each pair of species. We evaluated the predictive capacity of the morphological variables and diet over the degree of coexistence between species using a neural regression network. The best neural network was accepted (correlation of 0.87, training error < 0.006). The prediction error was 13.5 % (\u00b1 1.1) of the value of the coexistence index. Our findings indicate that the composition of cave bat assemblages in Cuba has not come about by chance. Rather, we found that the most functionally different species tended to coexist. This finding is consistent with the effect of competitive relationships driving the composition of species of cave bats in Cuba.",
