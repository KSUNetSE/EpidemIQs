We find analytical results determining extinction, mutual exclusion, and coexistence of the viruses by introducing the concepts of survival threshold and winning threshold. Furthermore, we show the possibility of coexistence in SIS-type competitive spreading over multilayer networks. Not only do we rigorously prove a region of coexistence, we quantitate it via interrelation of central nodes across the network layers. Little to no overlapping of layers central nodes is the key determinant of coexistence. Specifically, we show coexistence is impossible if network layers are identical yet possible if the network layers have distinct dominant eigenvectors and node degree vectors. For example, we show both analytically and numerically that positive correlation of network layers makes it difficult for a virus to survive while in a network with negatively correlated layers survival is easier but total removal of the other virus is more difficult. We believe our methodology has great potentials for application to broader classes of multi-pathogen spreading over multi-layer and interconnected networks.",

                    "abstract": "Members of a society interact using a variety of social behaviors, giving rise to a multi-faceted and complex social life. For the study of animal behavior, quantifying this complexity is critical for understanding the impact of social life on animals\u2019 health and fitness. Multilayer network approaches, where each interaction type represents a different layer of the social network, have the potential to better capture this complexity than single layer approaches. Calculating individuals\u2019 centrality within a multilayer social network can reveal keystone individuals and more fully characterize social roles. However, existing measures of multilayer centrality do not account for differences in the dynamics and functionality across interaction layers. Here we validate a new method for quantifying multiplex centrality called consensus ranking by applying this method to multiple social groups of a well-studied nonhuman primate, the rhesus macaque. Consensus ranking can suitably handle the complexities of animal social life, such as networks with different properties (sparse vs. dense) and biological meanings (competitive vs. affiliative interactions). We examined whether individuals\u2019 attributes or socio-demographic factors (sex, age, dominance rank and certainty, matriline size, rearing history) were associated with multiplex centrality. Social networks were constructed for five interaction layers (i.e., aggression, status signaling, conflict policing, grooming and huddling) for seven social groups. Consensus ranks were calculated across these five layers and analyzed with respect to individual attributes and socio-demographic factors. Generalized linear mixed models showed that consensus ranking detected known social patterns in rhesus macaques, showing that multiplex centrality was greater in high-ranking males with high certainty of rank and females from the largest families. In addition, consensus ranks also showed that females from very small families and mother-reared (compared to nursery-reared) individuals were more central, showing that consideration of multiple social domains revealed individuals whose social centrality and importance might otherwise have been missed.",

Competitive exclusion principle is the main principle that governs causative agentries of diseases competition. Identifying coexistence mechanisms is a core issue for studying the interactions of multi-strains. In this paper, we are concerned with the dynamics of a two-strain SIS epidemic model with general incidence rate on complex networks. We derive the basic reproduction numbers and the invasion reproduction numbers associated with each strain, which determine the competitive, exclusion and coexistence of the two strains. We strictly prove that the competitive exclusion principle holds in a global sense and the endemic equilibrium coexists uniquely and globally. Numerical examples visibly illustrate the evolution of the two strains.",
