By analyzing the conditions for the existence of endemic equilibrium points, we derive the basic reproduction numbers and outbreak thresholds for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. The epidemic model is then reconstructed and extensively analyzed using continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) methods. This analysis includes the investigation of transition probabilities, transition rate matrices, steady-state distributions, and the transition probability matrix based on the embedded chain. In numerical simulations, a notable concordance exists between the outcomes of CTMC and mean-field (MF) simulations, thereby substantiating the efficacy of the CTMC model. Moreover, the CTMC-based model adeptly captures the inherent stochastic fluctuation in the disease transmission, which is consistent with the mathematical properties of Markov chains. We further analyze the relationship between the system\u2019s steady-state infection density and the immunization rate through MCS. The results suggest that the infection density decreases with an increase in the immunization rate among susceptible individuals. The current research results will enhance our understanding of infectious disease transmission patterns in real-world scenarios, providing valuable theoretical insights for the development of epidemic prevention and control strategies.",

Numerous studies have investigated various methods to prevent or reduce the spread of disease during an outbreak. One of the most common approaches is network-centrality-based, which is computationally expensive, especially in networks with time-varying configurations. This paper proposes a novel immunizing strategy to control epidemics with SIR and SEIR models. This low-computation method clusters the network into subsets and selects the nodes to be immunized based on their in/out-degrees in each cluster. Our proposed algorithm is designed not only based on the network\u2019s centrality measures but also on the network\u2019s clusters to investigate the epidemic flow in a lower-dimensional subset. The effectiveness of our proposed method is illustrated via several numerical simulations using benchmark examples.",

In the present study, we deal with a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) metapopulation model where the epidemic process in each patch is represented by an SIR model and the mobility of individuals is assumed to be a homogeneous diffusion. We consider two types of patches including high-risk and low-risk ones under the assumption that a local patch is changed from a high-risk one to a low-risk one by an intervention. We theoretically analyze the intervention threshold which indicates the critical fraction of low-risk patches for preventing a global epidemic outbreak. We show that an intervention targeted to high-degree patches is more effective for epidemic control than a random intervention. The theoretical results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations for synthetic and realistic scale-free patch networks. The theoretical results also reveal that the intervention threshold depends on the human mobility network and the mobility rate. Our approach is useful for exploring better local interventions aimed at containment of epidemics.",

Under various vaccine action models, we consider both household-based vaccination schemes, in which the way in which individuals are chosen for vaccination depends on the size of the households in which they reside, and acquaintance vaccination, which targets individuals of high degree in the social network. For both types of vaccination scheme, assuming a large population with few initial infectives, we derive a threshold parameter which determines whether or not a large outbreak can occur and also the probability of a large outbreak and the fraction of the population infected by a large outbreak. The performance of these schemes is studied numerically, focusing on the influence of the household size distribution and the degree distribution of the social network. We find that acquaintance vaccination can significantly outperform the best household-based scheme if the degree distribution of the social network is heavy-tailed. For household-based schemes, when the vaccine coverage is insufficient to prevent a major outbreak and the vaccine is imperfect, we find situations in which both the probability and size of a major outbreak under the scheme which minimises the threshold parameter are larger than in the scheme which maximises the threshold parameter.",

                    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel epidemic model of computer virus on scale-free network with nonlinear infectivity is proposed. The spreading dynamics of the virus was analyzed. The spreading critical threshold for the model was presented. Theoretical analyses indicate that the outbreak of the virus is entirely determined by the threshold. Numerical simulations confirmed the analytical results. Introduction Internet provides conveniently various services and information to people. Meanwhile, the easy access and wide usage of Internet make it a primary target for viruses. In the past, outbreaks of computer viruses have brought about huge financial losses. As the major means of defending against viruses, antivirus software is more a technique than a science; it cannot predict the evolution of viruses and hence, cannot provide global prevention/control policies. With the dramatic increase in the number of virus, relying solely on measures to clear the viruses can not meet the ultimate needs. Facing the severe situation of virus\u2019 destroy, it\u2019s urgent for people to establish epidemic model, explore virus propagation characteristics and advance controlling schemes in the network information security field. The computer viruses bear a striking resemblance to their biological counterparts. Cohen [1] and Murray [2] inventively suggested to exploit the tools developed in epidemic dynamics of infectious diseases to study the spreading behavior of computer viruses. Following this idea, Kephart and White [3] established the first epidemic model of computer viruses. From then on, most epidemic models usually have been proposed based on the assumption that Internet is homogeneous network [4-6]. At the end of last century empirical studies report that Internet has scale-free properties [7-9]. Studies on epidemic spreading in SF networks present us with surprising result, such as absence of any epidemic threshold, hierarchical spread of epidemic outbreaks [10-12], and so on. Most previous work toward this direction was limited to three simplistic models: the SI model [13-14], the SIS model [15-16] and the SIR model [17-18]. However, most previous works mainly focus on the impact of the underlying topology and assume that the transmission is uniformly distributed among all links, that is, each infected individual will try to contact all its susceptible neighbors once within one time step. In fact, this kind of uniform transmission is induced from the assumption that each node\u2019s potential infectivity, counted by its possible maximal contribution to the propagation process within one time step, is strictly equal to its degree, i.e., \u2018infectivity\u2261degree\u2019. The node with very large degree is called hub in computer networks, whereas the node with great infectivity in epidemic contact networks is termed super-spreader. Thus, the above assumption means hub\u2261super-spreader. This assumption fails to consider that the infectivity of an infected computer is limited, because computer\u2019s processing capacity and network bandwidth are limited. In this paper, we aim to overlook the above defects and understand the spreading behaviors of computer viruses in Internet. We present a novel SIDS (susceptible-infected-detached-susceptible) epidemic model of computer virus to investigate the impact of nonlinear infectivity in Internet with the scale-free property. We obtain the corresponding spreading threshold and analyze the globally dynamic behaviors of the virus. Then, the numerical simulations are given, which are well consistent with the theoretical results. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we will briefly formulate this novel epidemic model. Then in Section 3, we determine the threshold value and analyze the International Conference on Information Sciences, Machinery, Materials and Energy (ICISMME 2015) \u00a9 2015. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 1684 globally dynamic behaviors of the virus. In Section 4, we carry out extensive numerical simulations to verify the theoretical analysis in Section 3. At last, in Section 5 we summarize this work. Model formulation It is well known [11-13] that the node degrees of Internet asymptotically follow a power law distribution, ( ) P k k \u03b3 \u2212 \ufffd , where ( ) P k stands for the probability that a node chosen randomly from Internet is of degree k . For this model in Internet, each computer is represented by a vertex of the network and the edges are communication links between them, along which the infection may spread. Let ( ) k S t , ( ) k I t and ( ) k D t be the densities of susceptible, infected, and quarantined vertexes of degree k at time t . Obviously, they must satisfy the normalized condition ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 k k k S t I t D t + + = if the total number of the node is fixed. The infection transmission is defined by the spreading rate\u03bb , at which each susceptible computer acquires the infection from an infected neighbor during one time step. An infected computer goes through a quarantine period firstly before becoming susceptible again. The rate constant of quarantine for infected computers is denoted by \u03bc . \u03c4 is the average quarantine period. All parameters are positive. Then by applying the mean-field technique to the above assumptions, we have the following dynamics model based on delay differential equations ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) k k k",
