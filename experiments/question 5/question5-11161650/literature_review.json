Then the nonvaccinated individuals will be infected with probability \u03b2. We apply the strategy to the susceptible-infected-recovered epidemic model in a multiplex network composed by two networks, where a fraction q of the nodes acts in both networks. We map this model of dynamic vaccination into bond percolation model and use the generating functions framework to predict theoretically the behavior of the relevant magnitudes of the system at the steady state. We find a perfect agreement between the solutions of the theoretical equations and the results of stochastic simulations. In addition, we find an interesting phase diagram in the plane \u03b2-\u03c9, which is composed of an epidemic and a nonepidemic phase, separated by a critical threshold line \u03b2c, which depends on q. As q decreases, \u03b2c increases, i.e., as the overlap decreases, the system is more disconnected, and therefore more virulent diseases are needed to spread epidemics. Surprisingly, we find that, for all values of q, a region in the diagram where the vaccination is so efficient that, regardless of the virulence of the disease, it never becomes an epidemic. We compare our strategy with random immunization and find that, using the same amount of vaccines for both scenarios, we obtain that the spread of disease is much lower in the case of dynamic vaccination when compared to random immunization. Furthermore, we also compare our strategy with targeted immunization and we find that, depending on \u03c9, dynamic vaccination will perform significantly better and in some cases will stop the disease before it becomes an epidemic.",

Heuristically motivated branching process approximations are described, which lead to a threshold parameter for the model and methods for calculating the probability of a major outbreak, given few initial infectives, and the expected proportion of the population who are ultimately infected by such a major outbreak.

An exact analytic solution of the governing equations is highly unlikely to be found (for any network) due to the appearing pair (and higher order) correlations. Nevertheless, the maximum average fraction $y_{I}$ of infected nodes in both SIS and SIR can be written as a quadratic form of the graph's Laplacian.

We systematically analyze these two issues\u2014relationships among differing results and levels of accuracy\u2014by studying the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model on uncorrelated configuration networks and a group of 56 real-world networks. In uncorrelated configuration networks the MFL and DMP methods yield identical predictions that are larger and more accurate than the prediction generated by the QMF method. As for the 56 real-world networks, the epidemic threshold obtained by the DMP method is more likely to reach the accurate epidemic threshold because it incorporates full network topology information and some dynamical correlations. We find that in most of the networks with positive degree-degree correlations, an eigenvector localized on the high k-core nodes, or a high level of clustering, the epidemic threshold predicted by the MFL method, which uses the degree distribution as the only input information, performs better than the other two methods.",

The network is given by a random graph following a multilayer configuration model where edges in different layers correspond to potentially infectious contacts of different types. We assume that the graph structure evolves in response to the epidemic via activation or deactivation of edges of infectious nodes. We derive a large graph limit theorem that gives a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the evolution of quantities of interest, such as the proportions of infected and susceptible vertices, as the number of nodes tends to infinity. Analysis of the limiting system elucidates how the coupling of edge activation and deactivation to infection status affects disease dynamics, as illustrated by a two-layer network example with edge types corresponding to community and healthcare contacts. Our theorem extends some earlier results describing the deterministic limit of stochastic SIR processes on static, single-layer configuration model graphs. We also describe precisely the conditions for equivalence between our limiting ODEs and the systems obtained via pair approximation, which are widely used in the epidemiological and ecological literature to approximate disease dynamics on networks. The flexible modeling framework and asymptotic results have potential application to many disease settings including Ebola dynamics in West Africa, which was the original motivation for this study.",

Namely, networks with scale-free properties do not acquire global immunity from major epidemic outbreaks even in the presence of unrealistically high densities of randomly immunized individuals. The absence of any critical immunization threshold is due to the unbounded connectivity fluctuations of scale-free networks. Successful immunization strategies can be developed only by taking into account the inhomogeneous connectivity properties of scale-free networks.

This structure can be captured by multilayer networks and can have major effects on the spreading of process that occurs over them, such as epidemics. In this letter we study a targeted immunization strategy for epidemic spreading over a multilayer network. We apply the strategy in one of the layers and study its effect in all layers of the network disregarding degree-degree correlation among layers. We found that the targeted strategy is not as efficient as in isolated networks, due to the fact that in order to stop the spreading of the disease it is necessary to immunize more than 80% of the individuals. However, the size of the epidemic is drastically reduced in the layer where the immunization strategy is applied compared to the case with no mitigation strategy. Thus, the immunization strategy has a major effect on the layer were it is applied, but does not efficiently protect the individuals of other layers.",

                    "abstract": "Background Adult immunization rates are below Healthy People 2020 targets. Our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention to improve adult immunization rates. Methods This prospective interventional before-and-after non-randomized study was conducted through the American Academy of Family Physicians National Research Network with 43 primary care physicians from a large multi-specialty healthcare organization (multicomponent intervention group n \u2009=\u200923; comparator group n \u2009=\u200920) in the United States. The multicomponent intervention included provider reminders, quarterly provider-level performance reports, provider education, patient visual aid materials, and standing orders on adult pneumococcal, influenza, and zoster immunizations. We assessed individual and comparative provider-level vaccination rates and missed opportunities detailing concordance with targets established by Healthy People 2020 for pneumococcal, influenza, and zoster immunizations. Results Vaccination rates increased after 12\u2009months in intervention and comparator groups respectively for: a). influenza from 44.4\u2009\u00b1\u200916.7 to 51.3%\u2009\u00b1\u200912.9% (by 6.9 percentage points, p \u2009=\u20090.001) and from 35.1\u2009\u00b1\u200919.1 to 41.3%\u2009\u00b1\u200914.2%, (by 6.2 percentage points, p \u2009=\u20090.01); b). pneumococcal vaccinations in older adults from 62.8\u2009\u00b1\u200917.6 to 81.4%\u2009\u00b1\u200916.6% (by 18.6 percentage points, for p \u2009<\u20090.0001) and from 55.9\u2009\u00b1\u200920.0 to 72.7%\u2009\u00b1\u200918.4% (by 16.7 percentage points, p \u2009<\u20090.0001); and c). zoster from 37.1\u2009\u00b1\u200913.4 to 41.9%\u2009\u00b1\u200913.1% (by 4.8 percentage points, p \u2009<\u20090.0001) and from 35.0\u2009\u00b1\u200918.7 to 42.3%\u2009\u00b1\u200920.9% (7.3 percentage points, p \u2009=\u20090.001). Pneumococcal vaccinations in adults at risk did not change from baseline in intervention group (35.7\u2009\u00b1\u200919.6 to 34.5%\u2009\u00b1\u200919.0%, p \u2009=\u20090.3) and improved slightly in comparator group (24.3\u2009\u00b1\u200920.1 to 28.2%\u2009\u00b1\u200920.0%, p \u2009=\u20090.003). Missed opportunities reduced after 12\u2009months, most noticeably, for: a). for influenza from 57.7 to 48.6% (by 9.1 percentage points, p \u2009<\u20090.0001) and from 69.7 to 59.6% (by 10.1 percentage points, p \u2009<\u20090.0001); b). pneumococcal vaccinations in older adults from 18.1 to 11.5% (by 6.6 percentage points p \u2009<\u20090.0001) and from 24.6 to 20.4% (by 4.3 percentage points, p \u2009<\u20090.0001) in intervention and comparator groups respectively. Conclusions Multicomponent interventions show promise in improving vaccination rates and reducing missed opportunities in older adults for pneumococcal and zoster vaccines and vaccination against influenza. Provider reminders remain the most effective strategy when delivered either as a component of these interventions or alone.",
