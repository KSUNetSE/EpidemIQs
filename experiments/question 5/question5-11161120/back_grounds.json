The model takes into account the effect of interactions between human and rodent populations, as well as certain realistic factors such as the complex network with a heterogeneous mean field and certain disease control measures such as vaccination and disease therapy. Although vaccines do not offer total protection against the disease, they can reduce the transmission of monkeypox, which could help reduce the spread of the virus in a population, as our results show. So to develop efficient strategies for epidemic control and prevention, we studied global sensitivity analysis to determine the parameters most influential on disease spread. The existence and overall stability of the disease\u2010free equilibrium are also discussed. The basic reproduction number R0 of the model is calculated. The results show that if R0 < 1, the disease\u2010free equilibrium of the model is globally asymptotically stable. In addition, the model\u2019s key parameters are calculated using a least\u2010mean\u2010squares curve fit to the real data.",

The application of IABM in the analysis of vaccination configurations is innovative, as a vaccinated individual can be infected depending on how their immune system acts against the invading pathogen, without a pre-established infection rate. Analysis at the microscopic level demonstrates the impact of vaccination on individual immune responses and infection outcomes, providing a more realistic representation of how the humoral response caused by vaccination affects the individual\u2019s immune defense. At the macroscopic level, the effects of different population-wide vaccination strategies are explored, including random vaccination, targeted vaccination of specific demographic groups, and spatially focused vaccination. The results indicate that increased vaccination rates are correlated with decreased infection and mortality rates, highlighting the importance of achieving herd immunity. Furthermore, strategies focused on vulnerable populations or densely populated regions prove to be more effective in reducing disease transmission compared to randomly distributed vaccination. The results presented in this work show that vaccination strategies focused on highly crowded regions are more efficient in controlling epidemics and outbreaks. Results suggest that applying vaccination only in the densest region resulted in the suppression of infection in that region, with less intense viral spread in areas with lower population densities. Strategies focused on specific regions, in addition to being more efficient in reducing the number of infected and dead people, reduce costs related to transportation, storage, and distribution of doses compared to the random vaccination strategy. Considering that, despite scientific efforts to consolidate the use of mass vaccination, the accessibility, affordability, and acceptability of vaccines are problems that persist, investing in the study of strategies that mitigate such issues is crucial in the development and application of government policies that make immunization systems more efficient and robust.",

In this study, we provide an analysis of epidemic dynamics using three well-known stochastic network models\u2014small-world networks (Watts\u2013Strogatz), random networks (Erd\u00f6s\u2013R\u00e9nyi), and scale-free networks (Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert)\u2014to assess the impact of different viral strains, lockdown strategies, and vaccination campaigns. We highlight the significant role of highly connected nodes in the spread of infections, particularly within Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert networks. These networks experienced earlier and higher peaks in infection rates, but ultimately had the lowest total number of infections, indicating their rapid transmission dynamics. We also found that intermittent lockdown strategies, particularly those with 7-day intervals, effectively reduce the total number of infections, serving as viable alternatives to prolonged continuous lockdowns. When simulating vaccination campaigns, we observed a bimodal distribution leading to two distinct outcomes: pandemic contraction and pandemic expansion. For WS and ER networks, rapid mass vaccination campaigns significantly reduced infection rates compared to slower campaigns; however, for BA networks, differences between vaccination strategies were minimal. To account for the evolution of a virus into a more transmissible strain, we modeled vaccination scenarios that varied vaccine efficacy against the wild-type virus and noted a decline in this efficacy over time against a second variant. Our results showed that vaccination coverage above 40% significantly flattened infection peaks for the wild-type virus, while at least 80% coverage was required to similarly reduce peaks for variant 2. Furthermore, the effect of vaccine efficacy on reducing the peak of variant 2 infection was minimal. Although vaccination strategies targeting hub nodes in scale-free networks did not substantially reduce the total number of infections, they were effective in increasing the probability of preventing pandemic outbreaks. These findings underscore the need to consider the network structure for effective pandemic control.",

Even with a partial vaccination of 30% of the population nodes selected considering their centrality measure ranking, such as degree, betweenness, or PageRank, it was possible to reduce the TI of 14%.

By analyzing the conditions for the existence of endemic equilibrium points, we derive the basic reproduction numbers and outbreak thresholds for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. The epidemic model is then reconstructed and extensively analyzed using continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) methods. This analysis includes the investigation of transition probabilities, transition rate matrices, steady-state distributions, and the transition probability matrix based on the embedded chain. In numerical simulations, a notable concordance exists between the outcomes of CTMC and mean-field (MF) simulations, thereby substantiating the efficacy of the CTMC model. Moreover, the CTMC-based model adeptly captures the inherent stochastic fluctuation in the disease transmission, which is consistent with the mathematical properties of Markov chains. We further analyze the relationship between the system\u2019s steady-state infection density and the immunization rate through MCS. The results suggest that the infection density decreases with an increase in the immunization rate among susceptible individuals.

However, individual cognition during the spreading seasons might also alter the vaccination strategy and inversely influence the epidemic spreading. We propose a coupled disease\u2013behavior model to describe the dynamic evolution of vaccination behavior during the spread of infectious diseases. The model integrates a susceptible\u2013infected\u2013vaccinated (SIV) model with the diffusion of vaccination behavior. We focus on the trade-off between perceptions of infection risk and the vaccination behaviors of neighbors, characterizing individual vaccination opinions. We introduce an opinion-critical value to map vaccination opinions into vaccination behavior. The vaccination coverage of the disease\u2013behavior model is studied in network models and real-world networks. In addition, when societal costs are measured based on the degree of initial vaccinees, the cost of randomly selecting initial vaccinees is lower than selecting individuals with high or low degrees as vaccinees. Evaluating an individual\u2019s ability to transmit vaccination behavior based on the neighbor\u2019s number is inappropriate.

Under various vaccine action models, we consider both household-based vaccination schemes, in which the way in which individuals are chosen for vaccination depends on the size of the households in which they reside, and acquaintance vaccination, which targets individuals of high degree in the social network. For both types of vaccination scheme, assuming a large population with few initial infectives, we derive a threshold parameter which determines whether or not a large outbreak can occur and also the probability of a large outbreak and the fraction of the population infected by a large outbreak. The performance of these schemes is studied numerically, focusing on the influence of the household size distribution and the degree distribution of the social network. We find that acquaintance vaccination can significantly outperform the best household-based scheme if the degree distribution of the social network is heavy-tailed. For household-based schemes, when the vaccine coverage is insufficient to prevent a major outbreak and the vaccine is imperfect, we find situations in which both the probability and size of a major outbreak under the scheme which minimises the threshold parameter are larger than in the scheme which maximises the threshold parameter.",

These networks reveal how social distancing measures and the public\u2019s reaction to the incipient pandemic affected the connectivity patterns within the city. We find that as the pandemic developed there was a substantial decrease in the number of individuals with many contacts. We further study the impact of these different network topologies on the spread of COVID-19 by simulating an SEIR epidemic model over these networks and find that the reduced connectivity greatly suppressed the epidemic. We then investigate how the epidemic responds when part of the population is vaccinated, and we compare two vaccination distribution strategies, both with and without social distancing. Our main result is that the heavy-tailed degree distribution of the contact networks causes a targeted vaccination strategy that prioritizes high-contact individuals to reduce the number of cases far more effectively than a strategy that vaccinates individuals at random. Combining both targeted vaccination and social distancing leads to the greatest reduction in cases, and we also find that the marginal benefit of a targeted strategy as compared to a random strategy exceeds the marginal benefit of social distancing for reducing the number of cases. These results have important implications for ongoing vaccine distribution efforts worldwide.",

Moreover, considering the limitations on the available resources, the dynamic constrained optimization problem of weights\u2019 adaptation for heterogeneous epidemic spreading networks is investigated. Due to the powerful ability of searching for global optimum, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are used as optimizers. One major difficulty is that the dimension of the problem is increasing exponentially with the network size and most existing EAs cannot achieve satisfiable performance on large-scale optimization problems.

By analyzing the conditions for the existence of endemic equilibrium points, we derive the basic reproduction numbers and outbreak thresholds for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. The epidemic model is then reconstructed and extensively analyzed using continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) methods. This analysis includes the investigation of transition probabilities, transition rate matrices, steady-state distributions, and the transition probability matrix based on the embedded chain. In numerical simulations, a notable concordance exists between the outcomes of CTMC and mean-field (MF) simulations, thereby substantiating the efficacy of the CTMC model. Moreover, the CTMC-based model adeptly captures the inherent stochastic fluctuation in the disease transmission, which is consistent with the mathematical properties of Markov chains. We further analyze the relationship between the system\u2019s steady-state infection density and the immunization rate through MCS. The results suggest that the infection density decreases with an increase in the immunization rate among susceptible individuals.

Under various vaccine action models, we consider both household-based vaccination schemes, in which the way in which individuals are chosen for vaccination depends on the size of the households in which they reside, and acquaintance vaccination, which targets individuals of high degree in the social network. For both types of vaccination scheme, assuming a large population with few initial infectives, we derive a threshold parameter which determines whether or not a large outbreak can occur and also the probability of a large outbreak and the fraction of the population infected by a large outbreak. The performance of these schemes is studied numerically, focusing on the influence of the household size distribution and the degree distribution of the social network. We find that acquaintance vaccination can significantly outperform the best household-based scheme if the degree distribution of the social network is heavy-tailed.

We also found that intermittent lockdown strategies, particularly those with 7-day intervals, effectively reduce the total number of infections, serving as viable alternatives to prolonged continuous lockdowns. When simulating vaccination campaigns, we observed a bimodal distribution leading to two distinct outcomes: pandemic contraction and pandemic expansion. For WS and ER networks, rapid mass vaccination campaigns significantly reduced infection rates compared to slower campaigns; however, for BA networks, differences between vaccination strategies were minimal. To account for the evolution of a virus into a more transmissible strain, we modeled vaccination scenarios that varied vaccine efficacy against the wild-type virus and noted a decline in this efficacy over time against a second variant. Our results showed that vaccination coverage above 40% significantly flattened infection peaks for the wild-type virus, while at least 80% coverage was required to similarly reduce peaks for variant 2. Furthermore, the effect of vaccine efficacy on reducing the peak of variant 2 infection was minimal. Although vaccination strategies targeting hub nodes in scale-free networks did not substantially reduce the total number of infections, they were effective in increasing the probability of preventing pandemic outbreaks. These findings underscore the need to consider the network structure for effective pandemic control.",

The model takes into account the effect of interactions between human and rodent populations, as well as certain realistic factors such as the complex network with a heterogeneous mean field and certain disease control measures such as vaccination and disease therapy. Although vaccines do not offer total protection against the disease, they can reduce the transmission of monkeypox, which could help reduce the spread of the virus in a population, as our results show. So to develop efficient strategies for epidemic control and prevention, we studied global sensitivity analysis to determine the parameters most influential on disease spread. The existence and overall stability of the disease\u2010free equilibrium are also discussed. The basic reproduction number R0 of the model is calculated. The results show that if R0 < 1, the disease\u2010free equilibrium of the model is globally asymptotically stable. In addition, the model\u2019s key parameters are calculated using a least\u2010mean\u2010squares curve fit to the real data.",

These are subnetworks composed of agents that are densely connected with a strong coupling, while the modules themselves are sparsely interconnected. As we show, beyond certain coupling thresholds, the systems within each module synchronize rapidly with a weighted-average dynamical system that evolves more slowly than the individual systems. Then, the average dynamical systems corresponding to each and all the modules synchronize among themselves. Furthermore, we establish global asymptotic stability for the overall network under the conditions that the average dynamics admit the origin as a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium and each system be semipassive. Finally, we explore stabilization techniques that consist in controlling the average dynamics to make the origin globally asymptotically stable.",
