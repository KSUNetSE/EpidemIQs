We show the convergence of the system when the number of nodes grows and characterize the scaling limits. Then, we prove the existence of optimal controls for the limiting equations formulated in the framework of game theory, both in the centralized and decentralized setting. We show how the characteristics of the graph (degree distribution) influence the vaccination efficiency for optimal strategies, and we compute the limiting final size of the epidemic depending on the degree distribution of the graph and the parameters of infection, recovery and vaccination. We also present several simulations for two types of vaccination, showing how the optimal controls allow to decrease the number of infections and underlining the crucial role of the network characteristics in the propagation of the disease and the vaccination program.",

To incorporate group structure of the underlying social network, we use a generalized version of the configuration model in which each node is a member of a specified number of triangles. SIR epidemics on this type of graph have earlier been investigated under the assumption of homogeneous infectivity and also under the assumption of Poisson transmission and recovery rates. We extend known results from literature by relaxing the assumption of homogeneous infectivity both in individual infectivity and between different kinds of neighbours. An important special case of the epidemic model analysed in this paper is epidemics in continuous time with arbitrary infectious period distribution. We use branching process approximations of the spread of the disease to provide expressions for the basic reproduction number R0\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$R_0$$\\end{document}, the probability of a major outbreak and the expected final size. In addition, the impact of random vaccination with a perfect vaccine on the final outcome of the epidemic is investigated. We find that, for this particular model, R0\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$R_0$$\\end{document} equals the perfect vaccine-associated reproduction number. Generalizations to groups larger than three are discussed briefly.",
