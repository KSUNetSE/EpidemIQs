        "answer": "The critical vaccination threshold in a targeted‑vaccination SIR epidemic on a sparse configuration‑model network is the smallest fraction of individuals that must be immunised so that the effective reproductive number falls below one, halting sustained transmission; for a homogeneous SIR model the threshold is vc = 1 − 1/R0, where R0 = β/γ, while on a configuration‑model graph the basic reproduction number depends on the degree distribution as R0 = (β/γ)·(⟨k²⟩−⟨k⟩)/⟨k⟩, giving a critical coverage vc = 1 − ⟨k⟩/[(β/γ)(⟨k²⟩−⟨k⟩)]. When vaccination is targeted to the highest‑degree nodes, the moments ⟨k⟩ and ⟨k²⟩ of the remaining (unvaccinated) network are reduced, so the same formula applies with the altered degree moments, meaning that fewer individuals need to be vaccinated than under random immunisation to achieve the same epidemic control.",

Percolation theory gives a critical fraction vc,targeted ≈ 1 – 1/(κ – 1) ≈ 1 – 1/⟨k⟩, but because the removal of the few highest‑degree nodes fragments the giant component much earlier, simulations show that vaccinating only the top 10–20 % of nodes can reduce the effective threshold to about 20–30 % of the population for typical ⟨k⟩ values (8–12).

    "agent_response": "Reason: To answer the user query comprehensively, I need to provide the formulas for critical vaccination thresholds for both random and targeted vaccination strategies in the context of SIR epidemics on two network models: the configuration model and the Erdős–Rényi (ER) random network. This involves the basic reproduction number R0 and how it is computed differently for these network structures and vaccination strategies.\n\nAction: I have already conducted searches for:\n1. Critical vaccination threshold formula for random vaccination on configuration model with SIR.\n2. The same for ER random network.\n3. Critical vaccination threshold formula for targeted vaccination on configuration model.\n4. The same for ER random network.\n\nObservation: \n- For the configuration model, the basic reproduction number is:\n  R0 = (β/γ) * (⟨k²⟩ - ⟨k⟩) / ⟨k⟩,\n  where β is transmission rate, γ recovery rate, ⟨k⟩ average degree, ⟨k²⟩ second moment of degree distribution.\n- The critical vaccination threshold for random vaccination, with perfect vaccine efficacy, is:\n  v_c = 1 - 1/R0.\n- For imperfect vaccine efficacy E (0<E≤1), it generalizes to:\n  v_c = (1 - 1/R0) / E.\n  \n- For ER random networks, R0 is:\n  R0 = β⟨k⟩ / γ,\n  and similarly:\n  v_c = 1 - 1/R0.\n\n- Targeted vaccination on configuration models reduces the degree moments of the unvaccinated network, hence:\n  The formula remains:\n  v_c = 1 - ⟨k⟩ / [ (β/γ)(⟨k²⟩ - ⟨k⟩) ],\n  but the degree moments ⟨k⟩, ⟨k²⟩ are computed over the remaining network after vaccination of the highest-degree nodes. This reduces R0 more effectively than random vaccination, requiring a smaller fraction vaccinated.\n\n- On ER graphs, targeted vaccination focusing on high-degree nodes is more efficient than random. While random vaccination requires coverage near 1 - 1/⟨k⟩, targeted vaccination reduces this threshold significantly (e.g., vaccinating top 10-20% hubs can suffice for typical average degrees).\n\nFinal Thought: I will articulate the explicit formulas, explain the role of degree moments, contrast random vs targeted vaccination, and highlight the differences between configuration model and ER random network in SIR epidemic context.\n\nFinal Answer: \n\nFor an SIR epidemic spreading on networks, the critical vaccination threshold (the minimum fraction of the population to vaccinate to prevent an outbreak) depends on the network structure and vaccination strategy. Below are the key formulas and explanations for random and targeted vaccination on configuration model and Erdős–Rényi (ER) random networks:\n\n1. **Configuration Model Network**\n\n   This model can represent heterogeneous contact patterns with a given degree distribution characterized by its moments — the average degree ⟨k⟩ and the second moment ⟨k²⟩.\n\n   - **Basic reproduction number (R0):**\n     \\[\n     R_0 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} \\cdot \\frac{\\langle k^2 \\rangle - \\langle k \\rangle}{\\langle k \\rangle}\n     \\]\n     where:\n     - β = transmission rate per contact,\n     - γ = recovery rate,\n     - ⟨k⟩ = average degree,\n     - ⟨k²⟩ = second moment of the degree distribution.\n   \n   - **Critical Vaccination Threshold for Random Vaccination (perfect vaccine, E=1):**\n     \\[\n     v_c = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0} = 1 - \\frac{\\langle k \\rangle}{(\\beta/\\gamma)(\\langle k^2 \\rangle - \\langle k \\rangle)}\n     \\]\n\n   - **With imperfect vaccine efficacy E (0 < E ≤ 1):**  \n     \\[\n     v_c = \\frac{1 - 1/R_0}{E}\n     \\]\n\n   - **Targeted Vaccination:**\n     When vaccination targets high-degree nodes first, the degree moments ⟨k⟩ and ⟨k²⟩ in the remaining (unvaccinated) network are reduced more sharply than by random vaccination. The same formula applies but with reduced moments:\n     \\[\n     v_c = 1 - \\frac{\\langle k \\rangle_{\\text{residual}}}{(\\beta/\\gamma)(\\langle k^2 \\rangle_{\\text{residual}} - \\langle k \\rangle_{\\text{residual}})}\n     \\]\n     This means fewer individuals need vaccination compared to random immunization for effective epidemic control.\n\n2. **Erdős–Rényi (ER) Random Network**\n\n   This network has a Poisson-like degree distribution with average degree ⟨k⟩ and a small variance.\n\n   - **Basic reproduction number (R0):**\n     \\[\n     R_0 = \\frac{\\beta \\langle k \\rangle}{\\gamma}\n     \\]\n\n   - **Critical Vaccination Threshold for Random Vaccination:**\n     \\[\n     v_c = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0} = 1 - \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta \\langle k \\rangle}\n     \\]\n     Since ER graphs are homogeneous, the vaccine coverage required is roughly \\(1 - 1 / \\langle k \\rangle\\) when parameters are normalized.\n\n   - **Targeted Vaccination:**\n     Targeting hubs (highest degree nodes) substantially reduces the effective reproduction number by fragmenting the network. Though no simple closed form universally applies, percolation theory approximates:\n     \\[\n     v_{c,\\text{targeted}} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{\\kappa - 1}\n     \\]\n     where \\(\\kappa = \\langle k^2 \\rangle / \\langle k \\rangle\\) (the ratio of second to first moment of degree). For ER networks, \\(\\kappa \\approx 1 + \\langle k \\rangle\\), implying a smaller \\(v_c\\) for targeted vaccination than random. Simulation studies often find that vaccinating the top 10-20% high-degree nodes suffices to prevent large outbreaks, compared to the much higher coverage needed under random vaccination.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The classical critical vaccination threshold in SIR models is \\(v_c = 1 - 1/R_0\\).\n- On **configuration model networks**, \\(R_0\\) depends on the ratio of the second moment to the first moment of the degree distribution.\n- On **ER networks**, \\(R_0\\) depends only on the average degree.\n- **Targeted vaccination** reduces the effective degree moments of the network, thereby reducing \\(R_0\\) and lowering the critical vaccination threshold compared to random vaccination.\n- Imperfect vaccine efficacy modifies thresholds by division with efficacy \\(E\\).\n\nThese formulas and insights allow for designing immunization strategies that account for network structure and optimize vaccine allocation to achieve herd immunity efficiently."
