The standard SEIR model is insufficient due to the epidemiological insight that B (bed-confined) is not the infectious stage; instead, most transmission happens in an unobserved infectious state I prior to B.

Rather, there is an earlier, unobserved infectious stage (I) that is responsible for generating most secondary cases. In order to capture both the observed “quarantine curve” B(t) and the final attack rate (~67%) – given a short overall generation time (about 1.9 days) – one must build a model that separates the hidden transmission period from the visible quarantine (B) period.\\n\\nLet’s compare the candidate model structures:\\n\\n1. SEIQR (with Q representing the quarantine state):\\n\\u2003 • In an SEIQR scheme, one would normally assume that infectious individuals (I) become symptomatic and then are “quarantined” (Q) – and that Q is associated with a strong reduction in onward transmission. \\n\\u2003 • If one uses SEIQR with Q = B, then one is implicitly assuming that most of the transmission occurs either before entering Q or that Q itself can be a stage where significant transmission occurs. This does not match the epidemiological insight for the boarding school outbreak, where the “Confined to Bed” curve is a delayed observable that does not drive transmission.\\n\\n2. SEIBR – the structure that consists of:\\n\\u2003 S – Susceptible,\\n\\u2003 E – Exposed (latent period),\\n\\u2003 I – Unobserved infectious (and most transmission occurs in this stage),\\n\\u2003 B – Bed-confined (observable symptomatic or “quarantined” but not the main driver of transmission),\\n\\u2003 R – Recovered.\\n\\u2003 • This structure clearly separates the “active” infectious period (I) from the symptomatic/quarantine state (B). In this setting, the generation time (∼1.9 days) is largely determined by the latent period plus the I period. With most transmission arising during I, the delay in appearance of symptomatically confined individuals (B) can be modelled separately, allowing one to capture the observed shape of B(t) and, at the same time, calibrate transmission so that the final attack rate is about 67%.\\n\\u2003 • Importantly, if B does not drive transmission, then the transition rate from I to B has to be set so that individuals spend enough time in I (with high transmissibility) to allow most secondary infection events, even though the observable (B) state appears later. The B-state dynamics then largely reflect a delayed, symptomatic “remnant” of the epidemic rather than the driver of it.\\n\\nImplications for the transition rate parameters are as follows:\\n\\u2003 • The rate at which individuals leave the latent (E) compartment (often denoted σ) must be relatively high to yield a short latency such that the start of the infectious period (I) occurs soon enough to match the overall generation time.\\n\\u2003 • The rate from I → B (say, γ₁) then controls how quickly infected individuals become symptomatic/confined. This rate must be calibrated so that even if individuals are infectious for as short as around 1–2 days, the B curve is delayed and spread out to match the observed quarantine curve.\\n\\u2003 • The overall basic reproduction number (R₀) must be consistent with a final size of ~67% in a closed population. That is, the effective transmission rate during the I period is chosen so that, even with the short 1.9‐day generation time, the epidemic “burns through” around two‐thirds of the population.\\n\\u2003 • In contrast, using an SEIQR model (with Q as quarantine) might force one to assign some transmission to the Q (or B) state; but if B is truly a confinement state with minimal transmission, then the SEIQR formulation would misrepresent the timing and allocation of infectiousness. Moreover, the parameters would then have to “artificially” adjust the transition rates—likely forcing an unrealistically rapid drop in infectiousness coinciding with the onset of quarantine—to reproduce both the epidemic speed and the attack rate.\\n\\nThus, the minimal mechanistic model that is faithful both to the epidemic timing (generation time) and the final attack rate is the SEIBR model. In this model, the hidden infectious period (I) is responsible for the epidemic spread (and hence determining R₀ and generation time), whereas the B state, representing confinement to bed, emerges with its own transition rate that is calibrated to reproduce the observed quarantine curve (B(t)). This separation has the following modeling implications:\\n\\n• Use SEIBR rather than SEIQR when the quarantined (B) state has little role in transmission.\\n• The transition rate out of the latent (E) stage must be high, to ensure a short latent period.\\n• The infectious period (I) must be long enough to generate nearly the full generation time (~1.9 days) even though the observable symptomatic phase (B) occurs later.\\n• The transition from I to B (and subsequent recovery) has to be tuned so that the number of individuals in B over time shows the correct “quarantine” (confined) curve, while transmission occurs primarily in I.\\n\\nIn summary, to capture both the shape of the observable B(t) and the overall attack rate in the outbreak, one should employ an SEIBR model. This formulation acknowledges that the main transmission phase occurs during the unobserved infectious period (I) and that the subsequent “confined to bed” (B) stage is effectively a delayed marker of the epidemic. The transition rates must be chosen accordingly: a fast progression through the latent phase, an infectious period (I) that sets the generation time and overall R₀, and a later transition into the confined state (B) that does not drive further transmission.To validate the mechanistic insight—that most transmission occurs during a hidden infectious state (I) while the observed “bed‐confined” state (B) is a delayed indicator—you can simulate epidemics on static networks using an SEIBR model. Here’s how:\\n\\n• Represent individuals as nodes on a fixed contact network (modeling the boarding school structure).  \\n• Assign compartments S, E, I, B, and R with transitions governed by realistic rates: a fast transition from E to I to capture the short latent period; an I period tuned to produce a generation time of ~1.9 days and most transmissions; and then a transition from I to B, which produces a delayed B(t) curve mimicking the observed “bed‐confined” data.  \\n• Run the simulation multiple times over the network and collect the epidemic curves: verify that (a) the B(t) curve matches the observed timing/shape, and (b) the final attack rate converges to about 67%.  \\n• Comparing this with an SEIQR variant (where quarantine equals transmission-reducing Q/B) will show that only with most transmission occurring in I (as modeled in SEIBR) can both epidemic speed and attack rate be simultaneously reproduced.\\n\\nThus, by tuning the transition rates in the SEIBR model and mapping it onto a static network, you can validate that the model recapitulates both the observed quarantine curve and the outbreak’s final size.Below is a concise answer that addresses all parts of the question:\\n\\n1. • To reproduce a generation time Tᵍ ≃ 1.9 days (which is the sum of the latent and the unobserved infectious periods), one must have\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003T_E + T_I = 1/σ + 1/γ₁ ≃ 1.9 days.\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003A plausible “minimal‐mechanistic” choice is to let the latent period be short (e.g., about 0.5 day) so that\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003σ ≃ 2.0 d⁻¹,\\n\\u2003and then the unobserved infectious period can be around 1.4 days so that\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003γ₁ ≃ 0.7 d⁻¹.\\n\\n\\u2003The key for (b) is that the observable bed‐confined (B) state shows a delay relative to the peak in I. This means that individuals do not become “bed‐confined” immediately after becoming infectious. In other words, the I → B transition needs to be sufficiently delayed relative to the inherent transmission period. This is achieved by choosing γ₁ so that most transmission occurs while individuals are in I and having the B stage last long enough (or its onset being sufficiently delayed) to shift the B(t) curve rightward. For instance, setting the B → R rate γ₂ to a lower value, say around 0.5 d⁻¹ (so that the average symptomatic period is about 2 days), further delays the visible B(t) curve relative to the I peak.\\n\\nThus, the minimal rates (or ranges) would be:\\n\\u2003– σ: roughly 1–2 d⁻¹ (with a “typical” choice near 2 d⁻¹ to give a latent period of ≲0.5 day),\\n\\u2003– γ₁: roughly 0.7–1.1 d⁻¹ (with a typical value near 0.7 d⁻¹ so that T_I ≃ 1.4 days),\\n\\u2003– γ₂: around 0.5 d⁻¹ or lower, so that B persists (and its peak is delayed) relative to the infectious phase.\\n\\n2. • In a model where nearly all transmission occurs in the I stage, the basic reproduction number is given by R₀ ≃ (β/γ₁). To achieve R₀ ≃ 8 the effective transmission rate must then satisfy\\n\\u2003\\u2003β ≃ R₀ × γ₁.\\nIf one takes for example γ₁ ≃ 0.7 d⁻¹, then β ≃ 8 × 0.7 ≃ 5.6 d⁻¹. Alternatively, if one were to choose a slightly shorter I period (e.g. γ₁ closer to 1 d⁻¹), then β would be around 8 d⁻¹. Hence, β is in the rough range 5–8 d⁻¹.\\n\\n3. • A common set of initial conditions (consistent with a closed outbreak in N = 763 individuals) is as follows:\\n\\u2003\\u2003S(0) = 762,\\n\\u2003\\u2003E(0) = 1,\\n\\u2003\\u2003I(0) = 0,\\n\\u2003\\u2003B(0) = 0,\\n\\u2003\\u2003R(0) = 0.\\nThis means the outbreak is seeded by a single exposed individual, with all others initially susceptible.\\n\\nAssumptions in this setup include:  \\n\\u2003– The latent period and the ensuing unobserved infectious period sum to 1.9 days,  \\n\\u2003– Transmission happens only in the I compartment,  \\n\\u2003– Once in the B compartment, individuals are non‐infectious, and  \\n\\u2003– The parameter choices yield an epidemic that in a closed population ultimately infects ≃67% of individuals (a property of R₀ ≃ 8 under the standard final-size relation).\\n\\nThis SEIBR approach, implemented on a static network (where individuals are nodes connected by fixed contacts), allows one to check how the epidemic curve of B(t) is delayed relative to the infectious period and to verify that the final attack rate matches the observed ~67% when the transmission rate is calibrated according to these parameter values.To validate the model with simulation over a static network, one would proceed as follows:\\n\\n• Represent each boarding school individual as a node in a fixed contact network (using the known N = 763 structure).\\n\\n• Implement the SEIBR model with the following transition rates:\\n\\u2003– Exposed to infectious rate σ (e.g., around 2 d⁻¹ so that the latent period is ≲0.5 day).\\n\\u2003– Infectious (I) to bed-confined (B) rate γ₁ (e.g., ~0.7 d⁻¹, giving ~1.4 days in I).\\n\\u2003– Bed-confined to recovered rate γ₂ (e.g., ~0.5 d⁻¹, ensuring that the symptomatic curve B(t) is delayed relative to I).\\n\\n• Set the transmission rate β such that nearly all transmission occurs in I – for instance, with γ₁ ≈ 0.7 d⁻¹, choose β ≈ 5.6 d⁻¹ to yield R₀ = β/γ₁ ≈ 8 (and a final attack rate of ~67%).\\n\\n• Seed the simulation with initial conditions: one exposed (E(0) = 1) and everyone else susceptible.\\n\\n• Run the simulation as an agent‐based process where each node transits between states according to the above exponential waiting times and transmission occurs only when an infectious (I) node contacts a susceptible node.\\n\\n• Validate by checking:\\n\\u2003– The combined latent and infectious periods result in a mean generation time of ~1.9 days.\\n\\u2003– The epidemic produces a B(t) curve (the observable “bed‐confined” curve) that is delayed relative to the infectious activity.\\n\\u2003– The final attack rate in the simulation approaches ~67%.\\n\\nIf the simulated epidemic dynamics over the static network match these conditions, then the SEIBR mechanistic model is consistent both with the observed outbreak shape and epidemiologic constraints.Using a network that incorporates social clustering best captures the boarding school context. Here’s a concise breakdown:\\n\\n1. A fully mixed (well‐mixed) population assumes every individual contacts all others equally, and an Erdős–Rényi (ER) graph (with mean degree ≈20) gives random connectivity. Neither explicitly represents the known residence/dormitory structure.\\n\\n2. A stochastic block model (SBM) with 4 blocks—each block representing a dormitory (with higher intra-block connection probability, e.g. p = 0.09 compared to inter-block p = 0.01)—better captures the structure of close social contacts (e.g., dormitory or class clustering). This improves the realism of simulated transmission dynamics: while the overall epidemic speed may be slightly reduced relative to the well‐mixed assumption (because of local saturation within clusters), the delayed B curve and global attack rate (≈67%) can be more accurately reproduced by adjusting the model parameters.\\n\\n3. Effect on R₀ and Final Attack Rate when Including Clustering:\\n\\u2003• In a clustered network (SBM), the same per-contact transmission rate β can yield a lower “network‐level” effective R₀ compared to a fully mixed population. This happens because clustering increases the probability that contacts overlap (i.e. the same individuals are repeatedly exposed), leading to faster local depletion of susceptibles.\\n\\u2003• Therefore, if one maintains the same effective transmission rate, the final attack rate may be lower than predicted by a fully mixed model. In practice, one might need to adjust β upward (or reassess R₀) in a clustered model to match the observed final attack rate (≈67%) while preserving the epidemic speed and the B(t) delay.\\n\\u2003\\nIn summary, for the boarding school outbreak scenario the SBM—with its dormitory-based clustering—is expected to best match the epidemic speed, attack rate, and delayed B curve observed. Clustering reduces effective mixing (and thus effective R₀ and final size for a given β) relative to fully connected models, so that parameter calibration must account for these network effects.A practical validation strategy is as follows:\\n\\n• Build a static network that represents the boarding school. Although an ER graph (mean degree ≈20) or a fully mixed population can be used, using a stochastic block model (SBM) with, say, 4 blocks (dormitories) and high within‐block (p ≈ 0.09) versus low between‐block (p ≈ 0.01) connection probability best captures social clustering.\\n\\n• Implement the SEIBR epidemic model on this network using the calibrated rates: a rapid latent-to-infectious transition (σ ≈ 2 d⁻¹), a moderately paced I→B transition (γ₁ ≈ 0.7 d⁻¹) to ensure a generation time of ~1.9 days, and a slower B→R (γ₂ ≈ 0.5 d⁻¹) to reproduce the delayed “bed‐confined” observable. The transmission rate β in I (≈5.6–8 d⁻¹) is set to achieve R₀ ≈ 8 and a final attack rate of ~67%.\\n\\n• Simulate the epidemic on your chosen network and compare key outcomes: the epidemic speed (driven by the I compartment), the final attack rate, and the delay in the B(t) curve relative to the I peak should be consistent with the historical data.\\n\\n• Note that including clustering (as via the SBM) will tend to reduce the effective R₀ compared to a fully mixed model because local contacts are redundant, so you may need to adjust β upward to achieve the same macroscopic R₀ and final attack rate. In other words, while an unclustered (well-mixed) model might expect R₀ = β/γ₁ directly, social clustering means that individual contacts are not independent, possibly reducing R₀ and epidemic size unless compensated by a higher β.\\n\\nThus, by calibrating the SEIBR model on a structurally realistic clustered network (using an SBM), you can validate that the model reproduces the observed epidemic speed, attack rate, and delayed B curve as expected for the boarding school influenza outbreak.')\nTo accomplish the task, the network and mechanistic model are designed as follows:\nEpidemicModelInfo(network_details='Network Structure for 1978 English Boarding School Influenza Outbreak Simulation:\\n\\nType: Static, undirected stochastic block model (SBM)\\nNodes: 763 (each node = 1 student)\\nBlocks: 4 (modeling dormitories/classes), of sizes [191, 191, 191, 190]\\nConnection probabilities: Intra-block p=0.09, inter-block p=0.01 (as per outbreak context)\\nTotal edges: 8,707\\nLargest connected component: 763 (entire network is connected)\\nGlobal clustering coefficient: 0.0586 (reflects moderate clustering, consistent with dense dorms and sparser inter-dorm mixing)\\nDegree distribution: min=7, max=37, mean <k>=22.82, second moment <k^2>=542.66\\n\\nPaths to files:\\n- Network file (sparse array): /Users/hosseinsamaei/phd/epidemiqs/output/england-boarding-sbm.npz\\n- Degree histogram: /Users/hosseinsamaei/phd/epidemiqs/output/england-boarding-degree-histogram.png\\n- Dormitory color-blocks sample layout: /Users/hosseinsamaei/phd/epidemiqs/output/england-boarding-blocks-layout.png\\n\\nNetwork structure: Each student is assigned to a dorm/block; there is high connection probability (p=0.09) among students in the same dorm, and much lower probability (p=0.01) between dorms.

Initial Condition**\n\n- **Seed**: One random node as exposed (E=1), all others S, zero elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Baseline Simulation: Calibration Scenario**\n\n- **Simulation Framework**: Use FastGEMF because \n  - the system is a mechanistic, Markovian compartmental model over a static network,\n  - all rates are simple constants (no time- or state-varying rates),\n  - outputs expose time-trajectories of compartments for direct comparison with observed data.\n- **Parameters**: Use values above as baseline.\n- **Number of Simulations**:\n  - Use multiple stochastic realizations (e.g., 50–100+) to estimate mean epidemic curves and confidence intervals, since the process is stochastic and school size is moderate.\n- **Simulation Duration**:\n  - Simulate for long enough (e.g., 30–50 days) for epidemic to run to completion (all B, I compartments depleted).\n- **Data Extraction**: \n  - Record the time series of B (bed-confined, directly comparable to “cases”) and C (convalescent, i.e. cumulative R or newly entered R).\n  - For final attack rate: compute ending fraction in R.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Variation and Sensitivity Testing**\n\n**A. Transmission Rate (beta) Tuning**\n\n- **Rationale**: Because SBM clustering may suppress outbreak size vs. well-mixed (theory and data), slightly vary `beta` (e.g., test 0.35, 0.38, 0.42 per day) to verify which best matches observed attack rate (~67%) and B(t) curve.\n- **Execution**: For each `beta`, perform full stochastic simulation set as above.\n- **Output**: Select model/parameter with best match to both AR and B(t) peak timing/shape.\n\n**B. Additional Rates, If Justified**\n\n- If B(t) curve shape is mismatched (too broad/narrow or wrong timing), consider varying `gamma1` (I->B) or `gamma2` (B->R) slightly within plausible bounds.\n- Document any and all parameter variants run.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Comparator/Validator Scenarios**\n\n**A.

Rather, there is an earlier, unobserved infectious stage (I) that is responsible for generating most secondary cases. In order to capture both the observed “quarantine curve” B(t) and the final attack rate (~67%) – given a short overall generation time (about 1.9 days) – one must build a model that separates the hidden transmission period from the visible quarantine (B) period.\\n\\nLet’s compare the candidate model structures:\\n\\n1. SEIQR (with Q representing the quarantine state):\\n\\u2003 • In an SEIQR scheme, one would normally assume that infectious individuals (I) become symptomatic and then are “quarantined” (Q) – and that Q is associated with a strong reduction in onward transmission. \\n\\u2003 • If one uses SEIQR with Q = B, then one is implicitly assuming that most of the transmission occurs either before entering Q or that Q itself can be a stage where significant transmission occurs. This does not match the epidemiological insight for the boarding school outbreak, where the “Confined to Bed” curve is a delayed observable that does not drive transmission.\\n\\n2. SEIBR – the structure that consists of:\\n\\u2003 S – Susceptible,\\n\\u2003 E – Exposed (latent period),\\n\\u2003 I – Unobserved infectious (and most transmission occurs in this stage),\\n\\u2003 B – Bed-confined (observable symptomatic or “quarantined” but not the main driver of transmission),\\n\\u2003 R – Recovered.\\n\\u2003 • This structure clearly separates the “active” infectious period (I) from the symptomatic/quarantine state (B). In this setting, the generation time (∼1.9 days) is largely determined by the latent period plus the I period. With most transmission arising during I, the delay in appearance of symptomatically confined individuals (B) can be modelled separately, allowing one to capture the observed shape of B(t) and, at the same time, calibrate transmission so that the final attack rate is about 67%.\\n\\u2003 • Importantly, if B does not drive transmission, then the transition rate from I to B has to be set so that individuals spend enough time in I (with high transmissibility) to allow most secondary infection events, even though the observable (B) state appears later. The B-state dynamics then largely reflect a delayed, symptomatic “remnant” of the epidemic rather than the driver of it.\\n\\nImplications for the transition rate parameters are as follows:\\n\\u2003 • The rate at which individuals leave the latent (E) compartment (often denoted σ) must be relatively high to yield a short latency such that the start of the infectious period (I) occurs soon enough to match the overall generation time.\\n\\u2003 • The rate from I → B (say, γ₁) then controls how quickly infected individuals become symptomatic/confined. This rate must be calibrated so that even if individuals are infectious for as short as around 1–2 days, the B curve is delayed and spread out to match the observed quarantine curve.\\n\\u2003 • The overall basic reproduction number (R₀) must be consistent with a final size of ~67% in a closed population. That is, the effective transmission rate during the I period is chosen so that, even with the short 1.9‐day generation time, the epidemic “burns through” around two‐thirds of the population.\\n\\u2003 • In contrast, using an SEIQR model (with Q as quarantine) might force one to assign some transmission to the Q (or B) state; but if B is truly a confinement state with minimal transmission, then the SEIQR formulation would misrepresent the timing and allocation of infectiousness. Moreover, the parameters would then have to “artificially” adjust the transition rates—likely forcing an unrealistically rapid drop in infectiousness coinciding with the onset of quarantine—to reproduce both the epidemic speed and the attack rate.\\n\\nThus, the minimal mechanistic model that is faithful both to the epidemic timing (generation time) and the final attack rate is the SEIBR model. In this model, the hidden infectious period (I) is responsible for the epidemic spread (and hence determining R₀ and generation time), whereas the B state, representing confinement to bed, emerges with its own transition rate that is calibrated to reproduce the observed quarantine curve (B(t)). This separation has the following modeling implications:\\n\\n• Use SEIBR rather than SEIQR when the quarantined (B) state has little role in transmission.\\n• The transition rate out of the latent (E) stage must be high, to ensure a short latent period.\\n• The infectious period (I) must be long enough to generate nearly the full generation time (~1.9 days) even though the observable symptomatic phase (B) occurs later.\\n• The transition from I to B (and subsequent recovery) has to be tuned so that the number of individuals in B over time shows the correct “quarantine” (confined) curve, while transmission occurs primarily in I.\\n\\nIn summary, to capture both the shape of the observable B(t) and the overall attack rate in the outbreak, one should employ an SEIBR model. This formulation acknowledges that the main transmission phase occurs during the unobserved infectious period (I) and that the subsequent “confined to bed” (B) stage is effectively a delayed marker of the epidemic. The transition rates must be chosen accordingly: a fast progression through the latent phase, an infectious period (I) that sets the generation time and overall R₀, and a later transition into the confined state (B) that does not drive further transmission.To validate the mechanistic insight—that most transmission occurs during a hidden infectious state (I) while the observed “bed‐confined” state (B) is a delayed indicator—you can simulate epidemics on static networks using an SEIBR model. Here’s how:\\n\\n• Represent individuals as nodes on a fixed contact network (modeling the boarding school structure).  \\n• Assign compartments S, E, I, B, and R with transitions governed by realistic rates: a fast transition from E to I to capture the short latent period; an I period tuned to produce a generation time of ~1.9 days and most transmissions; and then a transition from I to B, which produces a delayed B(t) curve mimicking the observed “bed‐confined” data.  \\n• Run the simulation multiple times over the network and collect the epidemic curves: verify that (a) the B(t) curve matches the observed timing/shape, and (b) the final attack rate converges to about 67%.  \\n• Comparing this with an SEIQR variant (where quarantine equals transmission-reducing Q/B) will show that only with most transmission occurring in I (as modeled in SEIBR) can both epidemic speed and attack rate be simultaneously reproduced.\\n\\nThus, by tuning the transition rates in the SEIBR model and mapping it onto a static network, you can validate that the model recapitulates both the observed quarantine curve and the outbreak’s final size.Below is a concise answer that addresses all parts of the question:\\n\\n1. • To reproduce a generation time Tᵍ ≃ 1.9 days (which is the sum of the latent and the unobserved infectious periods), one must have\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003T_E + T_I = 1/σ + 1/γ₁ ≃ 1.9 days.\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003A plausible “minimal‐mechanistic” choice is to let the latent period be short (e.g., about 0.5 day) so that\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003σ ≃ 2.0 d⁻¹,\\n\\u2003and then the unobserved infectious period can be around 1.4 days so that\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003γ₁ ≃ 0.7 d⁻¹.\\n\\n\\u2003The key for (b) is that the observable bed‐confined (B) state shows a delay relative to the peak in I. This means that individuals do not become “bed‐confined” immediately after becoming infectious. In other words, the I → B transition needs to be sufficiently delayed relative to the inherent transmission period. This is achieved by choosing γ₁ so that most transmission occurs while individuals are in I and having the B stage last long enough (or its onset being sufficiently delayed) to shift the B(t) curve rightward. For instance, setting the B → R rate γ₂ to a lower value, say around 0.5 d⁻¹ (so that the average symptomatic period is about 2 days), further delays the visible B(t) curve relative to the I peak.\\n\\nThus, the minimal rates (or ranges) would be:\\n\\u2003– σ: roughly 1–2 d⁻¹ (with a “typical” choice near 2 d⁻¹ to give a latent period of ≲0.5 day),\\n\\u2003– γ₁: roughly 0.7–1.1 d⁻¹ (with a typical value near 0.7 d⁻¹ so that T_I ≃ 1.4 days),\\n\\u2003– γ₂: around 0.5 d⁻¹ or lower, so that B persists (and its peak is delayed) relative to the infectious phase.\\n\\n2. • In a model where nearly all transmission occurs in the I stage, the basic reproduction number is given by R₀ ≃ (β/γ₁). To achieve R₀ ≃ 8 the effective transmission rate must then satisfy\\n\\u2003\\u2003β ≃ R₀ × γ₁.\\nIf one takes for example γ₁ ≃ 0.7 d⁻¹, then β ≃ 8 × 0.7 ≃ 5.6 d⁻¹. Alternatively, if one were to choose a slightly shorter I period (e.g. γ₁ closer to 1 d⁻¹), then β would be around 8 d⁻¹. Hence, β is in the rough range 5–8 d⁻¹.\\n\\n3. • A common set of initial conditions (consistent with a closed outbreak in N = 763 individuals) is as follows:\\n\\u2003\\u2003S(0) = 762,\\n\\u2003\\u2003E(0) = 1,\\n\\u2003\\u2003I(0) = 0,\\n\\u2003\\u2003B(0) = 0,\\n\\u2003\\u2003R(0) = 0.\\nThis means the outbreak is seeded by a single exposed individual, with all others initially susceptible.\\n\\nAssumptions in this setup include:  \\n\\u2003– The latent period and the ensuing unobserved infectious period sum to 1.9 days,  \\n\\u2003– Transmission happens only in the I compartment,  \\n\\u2003– Once in the B compartment, individuals are non‐infectious, and  \\n\\u2003– The parameter choices yield an epidemic that in a closed population ultimately infects ≃67% of individuals (a property of R₀ ≃ 8 under the standard final-size relation).\\n\\nThis SEIBR approach, implemented on a static network (where individuals are nodes connected by fixed contacts), allows one to check how the epidemic curve of B(t) is delayed relative to the infectious period and to verify that the final attack rate matches the observed ~67% when the transmission rate is calibrated according to these parameter values.To validate the model with simulation over a static network, one would proceed as follows:\\n\\n• Represent each boarding school individual as a node in a fixed contact network (using the known N = 763 structure).\\n\\n• Implement the SEIBR model with the following transition rates:\\n\\u2003– Exposed to infectious rate σ (e.g., around 2 d⁻¹ so that the latent period is ≲0.5 day).\\n\\u2003– Infectious (I) to bed-confined (B) rate γ₁ (e.g., ~0.7 d⁻¹, giving ~1.4 days in I).\\n\\u2003– Bed-confined to recovered rate γ₂ (e.g., ~0.5 d⁻¹, ensuring that the symptomatic curve B(t) is delayed relative to I).\\n\\n• Set the transmission rate β such that nearly all transmission occurs in I – for instance, with γ₁ ≈ 0.7 d⁻¹, choose β ≈ 5.6 d⁻¹ to yield R₀ = β/γ₁ ≈ 8 (and a final attack rate of ~67%).\\n\\n• Seed the simulation with initial conditions: one exposed (E(0) = 1) and everyone else susceptible.\\n\\n• Run the simulation as an agent‐based process where each node transits between states according to the above exponential waiting times and transmission occurs only when an infectious (I) node contacts a susceptible node.\\n\\n• Validate by checking:\\n\\u2003– The combined latent and infectious periods result in a mean generation time of ~1.9 days.\\n\\u2003– The epidemic produces a B(t) curve (the observable “bed‐confined” curve) that is delayed relative to the infectious activity.\\n\\u2003– The final attack rate in the simulation approaches ~67%.\\n\\nIf the simulated epidemic dynamics over the static network match these conditions, then the SEIBR mechanistic model is consistent both with the observed outbreak shape and epidemiologic constraints.Using a network that incorporates social clustering best captures the boarding school context. Here’s a concise breakdown:\\n\\n1. A fully mixed (well‐mixed) population assumes every individual contacts all others equally, and an Erdős–Rényi (ER) graph (with mean degree ≈20) gives random connectivity. Neither explicitly represents the known residence/dormitory structure.\\n\\n2. A stochastic block model (SBM) with 4 blocks—each block representing a dormitory (with higher intra-block connection probability, e.g. p = 0.09 compared to inter-block p = 0.01)—better captures the structure of close social contacts (e.g., dormitory or class clustering). This improves the realism of simulated transmission dynamics: while the overall epidemic speed may be slightly reduced relative to the well‐mixed assumption (because of local saturation within clusters), the delayed B curve and global attack rate (≈67%) can be more accurately reproduced by adjusting the model parameters.\\n\\n3. Effect on R₀ and Final Attack Rate when Including Clustering:\\n\\u2003• In a clustered network (SBM), the same per-contact transmission rate β can yield a lower “network‐level” effective R₀ compared to a fully mixed population. This happens because clustering increases the probability that contacts overlap (i.e. the same individuals are repeatedly exposed), leading to faster local depletion of susceptibles.\\n\\u2003• Therefore, if one maintains the same effective transmission rate, the final attack rate may be lower than predicted by a fully mixed model. In practice, one might need to adjust β upward (or reassess R₀) in a clustered model to match the observed final attack rate (≈67%) while preserving the epidemic speed and the B(t) delay.\\n\\u2003\\nIn summary, for the boarding school outbreak scenario the SBM—with its dormitory-based clustering—is expected to best match the epidemic speed, attack rate, and delayed B curve observed. Clustering reduces effective mixing (and thus effective R₀ and final size for a given β) relative to fully connected models, so that parameter calibration must account for these network effects.A practical validation strategy is as follows:\\n\\n• Build a static network that represents the boarding school. Although an ER graph (mean degree ≈20) or a fully mixed population can be used, using a stochastic block model (SBM) with, say, 4 blocks (dormitories) and high within‐block (p ≈ 0.09) versus low between‐block (p ≈ 0.01) connection probability best captures social clustering.\\n\\n• Implement the SEIBR epidemic model on this network using the calibrated rates: a rapid latent-to-infectious transition (σ ≈ 2 d⁻¹), a moderately paced I→B transition (γ₁ ≈ 0.7 d⁻¹) to ensure a generation time of ~1.9 days, and a slower B→R (γ₂ ≈ 0.5 d⁻¹) to reproduce the delayed “bed‐confined” observable. The transmission rate β in I (≈5.6–8 d⁻¹) is set to achieve R₀ ≈ 8 and a final attack rate of ~67%.\\n\\n• Simulate the epidemic on your chosen network and compare key outcomes: the epidemic speed (driven by the I compartment), the final attack rate, and the delay in the B(t) curve relative to the I peak should be consistent with the historical data.\\n\\n• Note that including clustering (as via the SBM) will tend to reduce the effective R₀ compared to a fully mixed model because local contacts are redundant, so you may need to adjust β upward to achieve the same macroscopic R₀ and final attack rate. In other words, while an unclustered (well-mixed) model might expect R₀ = β/γ₁ directly, social clustering means that individual contacts are not independent, possibly reducing R₀ and epidemic size unless compensated by a higher β.\\n\\nThus, by calibrating the SEIBR model on a structurally realistic clustered network (using an SBM), you can validate that the model reproduces the observed epidemic speed, attack rate, and delayed B curve as expected for the boarding school influenza outbreak.').\nTo accomplish the task, the network and mechanistic model are designed as follows:\nEpidemicModelInfo(network_details='Network Structure for 1978 English Boarding School Influenza Outbreak Simulation:\\n\\nType: Static, undirected stochastic block model (SBM)\\nNodes: 763 (each node = 1 student)\\nBlocks: 4 (modeling dormitories/classes), of sizes [191, 191, 191, 190]\\nConnection probabilities: Intra-block p=0.09, inter-block p=0.01 (as per outbreak context)\\nTotal edges: 8,707\\nLargest connected component: 763 (entire network is connected)\\nGlobal clustering coefficient: 0.0586 (reflects moderate clustering, consistent with dense dorms and sparser inter-dorm mixing)\\nDegree distribution: min=7, max=37, mean <k>=22.82, second moment <k^2>=542.66\\n\\nPaths to files:\\n- Network file (sparse array): /Users/hosseinsamaei/phd/epidemiqs/output/england-boarding-sbm.npz\\n- Degree histogram: /Users/hosseinsamaei/phd/epidemiqs/output/england-boarding-degree-histogram.png\\n- Dormitory color-blocks sample layout: /Users/hosseinsamaei/phd/epidemiqs/output/england-boarding-blocks-layout.png\\n\\nNetwork structure: Each student is assigned to a dorm/block; there is high connection probability (p=0.09) among students in the same dorm, and much lower probability (p=0.01) between dorms.

Ensure that all scecnarios and models are successfully simulated, there are no missing tasks, and the simulation phase is comprehensive and accurate.\nHere is the suggested plan to follow:\nCertainly! Here’s a detailed, step-by-step chain-of-thought plan for designing and executing the simulation phase to accomplish the calibration and comparison tasks for the 1978 English boarding school influenza outbreak, following the requirements, using FastGEMF or (if needed) other computational tools.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Model and Scenario Definition**\n\n**A. Baseline Model Construction**\n\n- **SEIBR compartmental model**: Define compartments S, E, I, B, R with transitions \n  - S -(I)-> E (infection, only via I)\n  - E → I (latent exit)\n  - I → B (symptom onset/isolation)\n  - B → R (recovery)\n- **Transition rates**:\n  - `beta`: _per-edge per day_ infection rate during I period (as calculated via heterogeneous mean-field theory and final size relation, baseline β ≈ 0.3789 per day)\n  - `sigma`: E → I rate = 2.0 per day\n  - `gamma1`: I → B rate = 0.7 per day\n  - `gamma2`: B → R rate = 0.5 per day\n\n**B. Network Structure**\n\n- **Primary (Empirically Motivated) Network**: Use the provided static SBM network (`england-boarding-sbm.npz`) matching school clusters (4 blocks/dorms, sizes, intra/inter probabilities).\n- **(Optional, For Baseline/Comparator) Well-Mixed Control**: Optionally, generate an Erdős–Rényi (ER) network or use a fully connected (well-mixed) model as a control to compare clustering effects.\n- **Verification**: Confirm that the loaded network is the correct size (N=763), with a giant component, roughly matching target degree and clustering coefficient.\n\n**C. Initial Condition**\n\n- **Seed**: One random node as exposed (E=1), all others S, zero elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Baseline Simulation: Calibration Scenario**\n\n- **Simulation Framework**: Use FastGEMF because \n  - the system is a mechanistic, Markovian compartmental model over a static network,\n  - all rates are simple constants (no time- or state-varying rates),\n  - outputs expose time-trajectories of compartments for direct comparison with observed data.\n- **Parameters**: Use values above as baseline.\n- **Number of Simulations**:\n  - Use multiple stochastic realizations (e.g., 50–100+) to estimate mean epidemic curves and confidence intervals, since the process is stochastic and school size is moderate.\n- **Simulation Duration**:\n  - Simulate for long enough (e.g., 30–50 days) for epidemic to run to completion (all B, I compartments depleted).\n- **Data Extraction**: \n  - Record the time series of B (bed-confined, directly comparable to “cases”) and C (convalescent, i.e. cumulative R or newly entered R).\n  - For final attack rate: compute ending fraction in R.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Variation and Sensitivity Testing**\n\n**A. Transmission Rate (beta) Tuning**\n\n- **Rationale**: Because SBM clustering may suppress outbreak size vs. well-mixed (theory and data), slightly vary `beta` (e.g., test 0.35, 0.38, 0.42 per day) to verify which best matches observed attack rate (~67%) and B(t) curve.\n- **Execution**: For each `beta`, perform full stochastic simulation set as above.\n- **Output**: Select model/parameter with best match to both AR and B(t) peak timing/shape.\n\n**B. Additional Rates, If Justified**\n\n- If B(t) curve shape is mismatched (too broad/narrow or wrong timing), consider varying `gamma1` (I->B) or `gamma2` (B->R) slightly within plausible bounds.\n- Document any and all parameter variants run.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Comparator/Validator Scenarios**\n\n**A. Structural Model Contrast**\n\n- (Optional) Compare baseline SBM vs. ER/well-mixed for same parameters to demonstrate effect of clustering (useful to justify network design/model choice).\n- Quantify difference in AR, peak timing, and B(t) profile.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Data Handling & Model Fit Evaluation**\n\n- **Data Extraction**: Programmatically extract daily B(t) and C(t) series from the provided `cases_data.xlsx` for each day of the outbreak.\n- **Fit Comparison**:\n  - Overlay simulated mean and variation (90% CI) in B(t) vs. observed data for visual and numerical comparison.\n  - Extract/compare:\n    - Peak B: _timing_ (day) and _height_ (number of individuals bed-confined)\n    - Final attack rate (fraction in R)\n- **Reporting**:\n  - For the best-fit scenario, tabulate R₀ (from model), observed and simulated AR, B(t) peak day and magnitude, and describe justification for the chosen model/rates.\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Robustness & Verification**\n\n- **Output Paths**: Always save all result data tables and each simulation’s output plots to the specified output paths:\n  - Results: `os.path.join(os.getcwd(),'output','results-ij.csv')`\n  - Plots: `os.path.join(os.getcwd(),'output','results-ij.png')`\n- **Execution Check**:\n  - For each scenario (each parameter set/`beta` variant), check simulation completes successfully, outputs are nonempty, and summary stats (e.g. in final AR) are available.\n- **Randomness**: For stochastic simulations, use random seeds/logging for reproducibility where possible.\n- **Error Handling**: Catch and record any failed/faulty simulations or unexpected behaviors (e.g. no outbreak, wrong network size).\n---\n\n### 7. **Summary of Scenario Structure**\n\n- **Baseline**: SBM, SEIBR model, β=0.3789, 1 seed, 100 runs, simulate ~50 days, extract B(t), C(t), AR.\n- **Variant(s)**: Same as baseline, but `beta` varied (if needed), and possibly gamma1/gamma2.\n- **Comparator**: (optional) Well-mixed/ER network.\n- **Outputs**: \n  - Data table of daily B(t), C(t), attack rate, final size for each.\n  - Plots: Mean + CI for B(t) and R(t) overlaying data; peak timing/highlight; summary table/annotation.\n- **Reporting**: Indicate which parameter set gives best fit to both AR and B(t); report model choice justification and cross-compare data fits.\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Validation and Documentation**\n\n- Save all code to reproducible script files (e.g., `simulation-ij.py`) with complete documentation.\n- For each result, annotate the scenario/parameter set and link simulation results, fit quality, and epidemiological match.\n\n---\n\n**End Goal:**  \nFrom these steps, you will generate a robust, documented, and justifiable simulation experiment set. This satisfies direct calibration to observed attack rate and time series, validates the mechanistic/structural model, and provides a transparent audit trail for all parameter/network/model decisions.\n\n---\n\n#### **Summary Table of Steps**\n\n| Step                   | Description                                                                 |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Model/Network Define   | SEIBR on SBM (and optionally, ER); set all rates                            |\n| Scenario Structure     | Baseline (calibration) + parameter/network variations                       |\n| Simulate               | Use FastGEMF, 100 runs per parameter set, extract time-series                |\n| Data Extraction        | Programmatically pull B(t), C(t), AR from both simulation and real data      |\n| Tuning/Comparison      | Test beta/gamma variants as needed to calibrate AR/B(t); cross-check with ER|\n| Output/Verification    | CSV results, PNG plots, ensure completion and data quality                   |\n| Reporting              | All result paths, simulation logic, fit measures, justification              |\n\n---\n\nAfter this scenario and simulation design phase, you’ll proceed to implement the code as per guidelines, following this planned structure.\n", "output": {"simulation_details": ["Simulated SEIBR epidemic process using FastGEMF on the actual SBM (4-block, 763-node English boarding school) network for the 1978 influenza outbreak.

The standard SEIR model is insufficient due to the epidemiological insight that B (bed-confined) is not the infectious stage; instead, most transmission happens in an unobserved infectious state I prior to B. Thus, a mechanistic SEIBR model is used: S (Susceptible) → E (Exposed) → I (Unobserved Infectious) → B (Bed-confined, non-infectious/quarantine) → R (Recovered/Convalescent).

Rather, there is an earlier, unobserved infectious stage (I) that is responsible for generating most secondary cases. In order to capture both the observed “quarantine curve” B(t) and the final attack rate (~67%) – given a short overall generation time (about 1.9 days) – one must build a model that separates the hidden transmission period from the visible quarantine (B) period.\\n\\nLet’s compare the candidate model structures:\\n\\n1. SEIQR (with Q representing the quarantine state):\\n\\u2003 • In an SEIQR scheme, one would normally assume that infectious individuals (I) become symptomatic and then are “quarantined” (Q) – and that Q is associated with a strong reduction in onward transmission. \\n\\u2003 • If one uses SEIQR with Q = B, then one is implicitly assuming that most of the transmission occurs either before entering Q or that Q itself can be a stage where significant transmission occurs. This does not match the epidemiological insight for the boarding school outbreak, where the “Confined to Bed” curve is a delayed observable that does not drive transmission.\\n\\n2. SEIBR – the structure that consists of:\\n\\u2003 S – Susceptible,\\n\\u2003 E – Exposed (latent period),\\n\\u2003 I – Unobserved infectious (and most transmission occurs in this stage),\\n\\u2003 B – Bed-confined (observable symptomatic or “quarantined” but not the main driver of transmission),\\n\\u2003 R – Recovered.\\n\\u2003 • This structure clearly separates the “active” infectious period (I) from the symptomatic/quarantine state (B). In this setting, the generation time (∼1.9 days) is largely determined by the latent period plus the I period. With most transmission arising during I, the delay in appearance of symptomatically confined individuals (B) can be modelled separately, allowing one to capture the observed shape of B(t) and, at the same time, calibrate transmission so that the final attack rate is about 67%.\\n\\u2003 • Importantly, if B does not drive transmission, then the transition rate from I to B has to be set so that individuals spend enough time in I (with high transmissibility) to allow most secondary infection events, even though the observable (B) state appears later. The B-state dynamics then largely reflect a delayed, symptomatic “remnant” of the epidemic rather than the driver of it.\\n\\nImplications for the transition rate parameters are as follows:\\n\\u2003 • The rate at which individuals leave the latent (E) compartment (often denoted σ) must be relatively high to yield a short latency such that the start of the infectious period (I) occurs soon enough to match the overall generation time.\\n\\u2003 • The rate from I → B (say, γ₁) then controls how quickly infected individuals become symptomatic/confined. This rate must be calibrated so that even if individuals are infectious for as short as around 1–2 days, the B curve is delayed and spread out to match the observed quarantine curve.\\n\\u2003 • The overall basic reproduction number (R₀) must be consistent with a final size of ~67% in a closed population. That is, the effective transmission rate during the I period is chosen so that, even with the short 1.9‐day generation time, the epidemic “burns through” around two‐thirds of the population.\\n\\u2003 • In contrast, using an SEIQR model (with Q as quarantine) might force one to assign some transmission to the Q (or B) state; but if B is truly a confinement state with minimal transmission, then the SEIQR formulation would misrepresent the timing and allocation of infectiousness. Moreover, the parameters would then have to “artificially” adjust the transition rates—likely forcing an unrealistically rapid drop in infectiousness coinciding with the onset of quarantine—to reproduce both the epidemic speed and the attack rate.\\n\\nThus, the minimal mechanistic model that is faithful both to the epidemic timing (generation time) and the final attack rate is the SEIBR model. In this model, the hidden infectious period (I) is responsible for the epidemic spread (and hence determining R₀ and generation time), whereas the B state, representing confinement to bed, emerges with its own transition rate that is calibrated to reproduce the observed quarantine curve (B(t)). This separation has the following modeling implications:\\n\\n• Use SEIBR rather than SEIQR when the quarantined (B) state has little role in transmission.\\n• The transition rate out of the latent (E) stage must be high, to ensure a short latent period.\\n• The infectious period (I) must be long enough to generate nearly the full generation time (~1.9 days) even though the observable symptomatic phase (B) occurs later.\\n• The transition from I to B (and subsequent recovery) has to be tuned so that the number of individuals in B over time shows the correct “quarantine” (confined) curve, while transmission occurs primarily in I.\\n\\nIn summary, to capture both the shape of the observable B(t) and the overall attack rate in the outbreak, one should employ an SEIBR model. This formulation acknowledges that the main transmission phase occurs during the unobserved infectious period (I) and that the subsequent “confined to bed” (B) stage is effectively a delayed marker of the epidemic. The transition rates must be chosen accordingly: a fast progression through the latent phase, an infectious period (I) that sets the generation time and overall R₀, and a later transition into the confined state (B) that does not drive further transmission.To validate the mechanistic insight—that most transmission occurs during a hidden infectious state (I) while the observed “bed‐confined” state (B) is a delayed indicator—you can simulate epidemics on static networks using an SEIBR model. Here’s how:\\n\\n• Represent individuals as nodes on a fixed contact network (modeling the boarding school structure).  \\n• Assign compartments S, E, I, B, and R with transitions governed by realistic rates: a fast transition from E to I to capture the short latent period; an I period tuned to produce a generation time of ~1.9 days and most transmissions; and then a transition from I to B, which produces a delayed B(t) curve mimicking the observed “bed‐confined” data.  \\n• Run the simulation multiple times over the network and collect the epidemic curves: verify that (a) the B(t) curve matches the observed timing/shape, and (b) the final attack rate converges to about 67%.  \\n• Comparing this with an SEIQR variant (where quarantine equals transmission-reducing Q/B) will show that only with most transmission occurring in I (as modeled in SEIBR) can both epidemic speed and attack rate be simultaneously reproduced.\\n\\nThus, by tuning the transition rates in the SEIBR model and mapping it onto a static network, you can validate that the model recapitulates both the observed quarantine curve and the outbreak’s final size.Below is a concise answer that addresses all parts of the question:\\n\\n1. • To reproduce a generation time Tᵍ ≃ 1.9 days (which is the sum of the latent and the unobserved infectious periods), one must have\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003T_E + T_I = 1/σ + 1/γ₁ ≃ 1.9 days.\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003A plausible “minimal‐mechanistic” choice is to let the latent period be short (e.g., about 0.5 day) so that\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003σ ≃ 2.0 d⁻¹,\\n\\u2003and then the unobserved infectious period can be around 1.4 days so that\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003γ₁ ≃ 0.7 d⁻¹.\\n\\n\\u2003The key for (b) is that the observable bed‐confined (B) state shows a delay relative to the peak in I. This means that individuals do not become “bed‐confined” immediately after becoming infectious. In other words, the I → B transition needs to be sufficiently delayed relative to the inherent transmission period. This is achieved by choosing γ₁ so that most transmission occurs while individuals are in I and having the B stage last long enough (or its onset being sufficiently delayed) to shift the B(t) curve rightward. For instance, setting the B → R rate γ₂ to a lower value, say around 0.5 d⁻¹ (so that the average symptomatic period is about 2 days), further delays the visible B(t) curve relative to the I peak.\\n\\nThus, the minimal rates (or ranges) would be:\\n\\u2003– σ: roughly 1–2 d⁻¹ (with a “typical” choice near 2 d⁻¹ to give a latent period of ≲0.5 day),\\n\\u2003– γ₁: roughly 0.7–1.1 d⁻¹ (with a typical value near 0.7 d⁻¹ so that T_I ≃ 1.4 days),\\n\\u2003– γ₂: around 0.5 d⁻¹ or lower, so that B persists (and its peak is delayed) relative to the infectious phase.\\n\\n2. • In a model where nearly all transmission occurs in the I stage, the basic reproduction number is given by R₀ ≃ (β/γ₁). To achieve R₀ ≃ 8 the effective transmission rate must then satisfy\\n\\u2003\\u2003β ≃ R₀ × γ₁.\\nIf one takes for example γ₁ ≃ 0.7 d⁻¹, then β ≃ 8 × 0.7 ≃ 5.6 d⁻¹. Alternatively, if one were to choose a slightly shorter I period (e.g. γ₁ closer to 1 d⁻¹), then β would be around 8 d⁻¹. Hence, β is in the rough range 5–8 d⁻¹.\\n\\n3. • A common set of initial conditions (consistent with a closed outbreak in N = 763 individuals) is as follows:\\n\\u2003\\u2003S(0) = 762,\\n\\u2003\\u2003E(0) = 1,\\n\\u2003\\u2003I(0) = 0,\\n\\u2003\\u2003B(0) = 0,\\n\\u2003\\u2003R(0) = 0.\\nThis means the outbreak is seeded by a single exposed individual, with all others initially susceptible.\\n\\nAssumptions in this setup include:  \\n\\u2003– The latent period and the ensuing unobserved infectious period sum to 1.9 days,  \\n\\u2003– Transmission happens only in the I compartment,  \\n\\u2003– Once in the B compartment, individuals are non‐infectious, and  \\n\\u2003– The parameter choices yield an epidemic that in a closed population ultimately infects ≃67% of individuals (a property of R₀ ≃ 8 under the standard final-size relation).\\n\\nThis SEIBR approach, implemented on a static network (where individuals are nodes connected by fixed contacts), allows one to check how the epidemic curve of B(t) is delayed relative to the infectious period and to verify that the final attack rate matches the observed ~67% when the transmission rate is calibrated according to these parameter values.To validate the model with simulation over a static network, one would proceed as follows:\\n\\n• Represent each boarding school individual as a node in a fixed contact network (using the known N = 763 structure).\\n\\n• Implement the SEIBR model with the following transition rates:\\n\\u2003– Exposed to infectious rate σ (e.g., around 2 d⁻¹ so that the latent period is ≲0.5 day).\\n\\u2003– Infectious (I) to bed-confined (B) rate γ₁ (e.g., ~0.7 d⁻¹, giving ~1.4 days in I).\\n\\u2003– Bed-confined to recovered rate γ₂ (e.g., ~0.5 d⁻¹, ensuring that the symptomatic curve B(t) is delayed relative to I).\\n\\n• Set the transmission rate β such that nearly all transmission occurs in I – for instance, with γ₁ ≈ 0.7 d⁻¹, choose β ≈ 5.6 d⁻¹ to yield R₀ = β/γ₁ ≈ 8 (and a final attack rate of ~67%).\\n\\n• Seed the simulation with initial conditions: one exposed (E(0) = 1) and everyone else susceptible.\\n\\n• Run the simulation as an agent‐based process where each node transits between states according to the above exponential waiting times and transmission occurs only when an infectious (I) node contacts a susceptible node.\\n\\n• Validate by checking:\\n\\u2003– The combined latent and infectious periods result in a mean generation time of ~1.9 days.\\n\\u2003– The epidemic produces a B(t) curve (the observable “bed‐confined” curve) that is delayed relative to the infectious activity.\\n\\u2003– The final attack rate in the simulation approaches ~67%.\\n\\nIf the simulated epidemic dynamics over the static network match these conditions, then the SEIBR mechanistic model is consistent both with the observed outbreak shape and epidemiologic constraints.Using a network that incorporates social clustering best captures the boarding school context. Here’s a concise breakdown:\\n\\n1. A fully mixed (well‐mixed) population assumes every individual contacts all others equally, and an Erdős–Rényi (ER) graph (with mean degree ≈20) gives random connectivity. Neither explicitly represents the known residence/dormitory structure.\\n\\n2. A stochastic block model (SBM) with 4 blocks—each block representing a dormitory (with higher intra-block connection probability, e.g. p = 0.09 compared to inter-block p = 0.01)—better captures the structure of close social contacts (e.g., dormitory or class clustering). This improves the realism of simulated transmission dynamics: while the overall epidemic speed may be slightly reduced relative to the well‐mixed assumption (because of local saturation within clusters), the delayed B curve and global attack rate (≈67%) can be more accurately reproduced by adjusting the model parameters.\\n\\n3. Effect on R₀ and Final Attack Rate when Including Clustering:\\n\\u2003• In a clustered network (SBM), the same per-contact transmission rate β can yield a lower “network‐level” effective R₀ compared to a fully mixed population. This happens because clustering increases the probability that contacts overlap (i.e. the same individuals are repeatedly exposed), leading to faster local depletion of susceptibles.\\n\\u2003• Therefore, if one maintains the same effective transmission rate, the final attack rate may be lower than predicted by a fully mixed model. In practice, one might need to adjust β upward (or reassess R₀) in a clustered model to match the observed final attack rate (≈67%) while preserving the epidemic speed and the B(t) delay.\\n\\u2003\\nIn summary, for the boarding school outbreak scenario the SBM—with its dormitory-based clustering—is expected to best match the epidemic speed, attack rate, and delayed B curve observed. Clustering reduces effective mixing (and thus effective R₀ and final size for a given β) relative to fully connected models, so that parameter calibration must account for these network effects.A practical validation strategy is as follows:\\n\\n• Build a static network that represents the boarding school. Although an ER graph (mean degree ≈20) or a fully mixed population can be used, using a stochastic block model (SBM) with, say, 4 blocks (dormitories) and high within‐block (p ≈ 0.09) versus low between‐block (p ≈ 0.01) connection probability best captures social clustering.\\n\\n• Implement the SEIBR epidemic model on this network using the calibrated rates: a rapid latent-to-infectious transition (σ ≈ 2 d⁻¹), a moderately paced I→B transition (γ₁ ≈ 0.7 d⁻¹) to ensure a generation time of ~1.9 days, and a slower B→R (γ₂ ≈ 0.5 d⁻¹) to reproduce the delayed “bed‐confined” observable. The transmission rate β in I (≈5.6–8 d⁻¹) is set to achieve R₀ ≈ 8 and a final attack rate of ~67%.\\n\\n• Simulate the epidemic on your chosen network and compare key outcomes: the epidemic speed (driven by the I compartment), the final attack rate, and the delay in the B(t) curve relative to the I peak should be consistent with the historical data.\\n\\n• Note that including clustering (as via the SBM) will tend to reduce the effective R₀ compared to a fully mixed model because local contacts are redundant, so you may need to adjust β upward to achieve the same macroscopic R₀ and final attack rate. In other words, while an unclustered (well-mixed) model might expect R₀ = β/γ₁ directly, social clustering means that individual contacts are not independent, possibly reducing R₀ and epidemic size unless compensated by a higher β.\\n\\nThus, by calibrating the SEIBR model on a structurally realistic clustered network (using an SBM), you can validate that the model reproduces the observed epidemic speed, attack rate, and delayed B curve as expected for the boarding school influenza outbreak.').\nTo accomplish the task, the network and mechanistic model are designed as follows:\nEpidemicModelInfo(network_details='Network Structure for 1978 English Boarding School Influenza Outbreak Simulation:\\n\\nType: Static, undirected stochastic block model (SBM)\\nNodes: 763 (each node = 1 student)\\nBlocks: 4 (modeling dormitories/classes), of sizes [191, 191, 191, 190]\\nConnection probabilities: Intra-block p=0.09, inter-block p=0.01 (as per outbreak context)\\nTotal edges: 8,707\\nLargest connected component: 763 (entire network is connected)\\nGlobal clustering coefficient: 0.0586 (reflects moderate clustering, consistent with dense dorms and sparser inter-dorm mixing)\\nDegree distribution: min=7, max=37, mean <k>=22.82, second moment <k^2>=542.66\\n\\nPaths to files:\\n- Network file (sparse array): /Users/hosseinsamaei/phd/epidemiqs/output/england-boarding-sbm.npz\\n- Degree histogram: /Users/hosseinsamaei/phd/epidemiqs/output/england-boarding-degree-histogram.png\\n- Dormitory color-blocks sample layout: /Users/hosseinsamaei/phd/epidemiqs/output/england-boarding-blocks-layout.png\\n\\nNetwork structure: Each student is assigned to a dorm/block; there is high connection probability (p=0.09) among students in the same dorm, and much lower probability (p=0.01) between dorms.
