What Can Be Estimated from Daily B and C Data?\\n\\nSince only the time‐series data for B(t) and C(t) and the known population N are available, only those parameters that directly influence the observed trajectories can be uniquely “backed out” (provided one has a good model fit and reasonable model assumptions). In practice, one finds:\\n\\na) The “B‐curve” (the daily number in bed) is influenced by the follow‐up dynamics:\\n\\u2003• The I → B rate, κ, essentially governs the delay and timing with which infected individuals show up in the B compartment. (Its estimation comes from the time of the peak and the speed of ascent.)\\n\\u2003• The B → C rate, γ, is reflected in the “exit” from the B compartment (such as the decay tails of the B curve). Thus, γ can be estimated fairly directly via the rate at which the number of confined individuals leaves that compartment.\\n\\nb) Recovery (C) data provide an integral “output” of the epidemic. They are useful to calibrate the overall number of cases (the final attack rate) and to “anchor” the time integral of incidence. In particular, if one wishes the cumulative number of infections (B + C eventually, modulo any delays) to be around 67% of N, then one must pick the remaining parameters—the infection‐spreading part—such that the final size relation is satisfied.\\n\\nHowever, note that the unobserved compartments (E and I) and the infection process per se depend on both the transmission parameter β and the rates σ and κ. In many routine epidemic models (like an SEIR or its extensions), only *combinations* of parameters are identifiable from incidence curves. In our case, the following issues arise:\\n\\n• From the B and C data alone one can “pin down” κ and γ (given that the delay from I to B and the exit from B are seen in the shape of the B curve).  \\n• In contrast, σ (the rate of progression from exposed to infectious) is not uniquely determined by B and C when no E curve is available. Its value must typically be assumed or fixed based on prior biological knowledge.  \\n• Infection dynamics (and hence the overall epidemic size or final attack rate of around 67%) are determined by both the transmission parameter β and the average period that an individual spends in the infectious, non‐confined state (which is 1/κ). Typically only the combination (in particular, the product β · (1/κ)) is strongly identifiable through the exponential growth rate in the early phase and via the final size equation.\\n\\nThus, from the available data one can uniquely estimate (or fit) the “observable” transition B → C (γ) and aspects of the delay I → B (κ) and even the product β/κ (which then fixes R₀ given the final attack rate). But σ remains non‐identifiable unless we assume (or fix) its value from external data. Similarly, initial conditions in the hidden compartments (E and I) must be assumed to be “small” or fixed at the onset of the epidemic.\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\n3. Fitting the Model to the B Curve and Matching a 67% Final Attack Rate\\n\\n(a) Fitting the B (bed confinement) curve:\\n\\u2003• You would integrate the model ODEs and adjust parameters to match the daily number in B.\\n\\u2003• The timing and shape of the B curve are strongly influenced by κ and γ. It is common to assume the latent period (1/σ) from other epidemiological data.\\n\\u2003• You might fix σ from literature (e.g., 1/σ ≈ 3–5 days) and then adjust κ to capture the onset of symptomatic (confinement) cases, while γ is estimated from the B→C transition dynamics.\\n\\n(b) Matching a final attack rate of ~67% (i.e. final cumulative infected ≈0.67N):\\n\\u2003• The cumulative number of individuals infected (i.e. who have passed through E, I, and B and ended in C, plus possibly those still in B) is determined by the basic reproduction number R₀.  \\n\\u2003• Using the final-size relation (which, for standard SIR-like dynamics, satisfies S(∞)/N = exp[–R₀ (1 – S(∞)/N)]), you can “back-calculate” the needed R₀ value (and hence the ratio β/κ) to yield a final fraction infected of about 0.67.\\n\\u2003• Thus, one adjusts β (if κ is already estimated) so that the solution of the equations yields S(∞)/N ≈ 0.33.  \\n\\u2003• Note that this procedure implicitly assumes that the “core” epidemic dynamics (S, E, I dynamics) follow the simple ordinary differential equations with no additional external forcing.\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\n4. Equation for R₀\\n\\nUnder the assumptions that only the “I” compartment is responsible for transmission and that infected individuals spend an average time (1/κ) in the highly infectious I\\xa0state, the basic reproduction number R₀ is given by\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = (β / κ)\\n\\nHere, β is the effective transmission parameter (that is, the rate at which an infectious individual makes sufficient contact to infect a susceptible person) and 1/κ is the average duration in the undetected infectious state. (This is under the assumption that no further transmission occurs from the individuals once they enter B because they are confined.) If one wished to refine the definition by including a nonzero contribution from later compartments or delay due to the latent period, then one would have to include that effect; however, given the assumed structure (E not being infectious, B not transmitting) the above formula is appropriate.\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\n5. Assumptions Required\\n\\nTo uniquely determine the parameters from the observed B and C data, one must assume:\\n\\u2003• That the structure of the transmission model is correct (e.g. that only I is infectious and that B are effectively isolated).  \\n\\u2003• Known (or assumed) values for the latent period (1/σ) from external studies.  \\n\\u2003• Homogeneous mixing and a closed population (N is known and no new individuals enter or leave, except via infection/recovery).  \\n\\u2003• That the recording of B and C is essentially complete (i.e. no systematic under-reporting or delays not modeled by the transitions).  \\n\\u2003• That the various rates do not change with time (i.e. constant parameters) so that the observed developments uniquely reflect the dynamics.\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\n6. Summary Answer\\n\\n• The observed B and C data allow you to uniquely estimate those parameters that govern the transitions which directly “feed into” the observed quantities: notably, κ (the I→B rate) and γ (the B→C rate).  \\n• The estimation of σ (E→I rate) is not unique unless you assume a value based on prior knowledge, because the E compartment is never directly observed.  \\n• In addition, the transmission parameter β is only identifiable up to the combination β/κ since only the product (determining the effective reproduction number R₀) matters for the epidemic growth and final size.  \\n• To reproduce a final attack rate (total infection) of about 67% you must choose β (given κ) so that the effective reproduction number (and hence the final size given by S(∞)/N = exp[–R₀ (1 – S(∞)/N)]) yields approximately 67% of the population infected.  \\n• Finally, under the assumptions made (that only the I compartment is infectious), the basic reproduction number R₀ is given by\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = β/κ .\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\nThis analysis explains the identifiability of the model and the assumptions required. It also explains how to fit the B curve and tune the model to achieve the target final attack rate.Below is a concise answer that ties together the analytical identifiability with simulation‐based validation on static networks:\\n\\n1. You first specify the mechanistic S → E → I → B → C process on a static network (e.g., an Erdős–Rényi or similar network) where nodes represent individuals and edges reflect contacts. Transition times from E → I, I → B, and B → C are simulated as exponentially distributed waiting times using the rates σ, κ, and γ respectively. Only the I compartment is “active” in transmitting the infection along edges with infection probability related to β.\\n\\n2. In validating the analytical solution using simulation, you:\\n\\u2003• Reproduce the B (confined) and C (recovery) time series by running the simulation and aggregating the compartment counts at each time step.\\n\\u2003• Confirm that the simulated B curve’s timing and shape match the parameter–driven delays (of κ and γ).\\n\\u2003• Adjust β (and hence the effective reproduction number R₀ = β/κ) so that the final fraction of infected individuals (final attack rate, summed over B and C) is around 67%.\\n\\u2003• Compare these outputs with the ODE model predictions (using the same parameters) to ensure that the observable dynamics from the simulation are in line with the model’s identifiability assumptions.\\n\\n3. In this way, by performing simulation on a network, you validate that only the parameters related to transitions into the observable states (κ and γ, and the combination β/κ) can be uniquely calibrated from B and C data, while σ must be externally fixed.\\n\\nThe following Python code snippet (saved in a script named “simulate-epidemic-network.py”) demonstrates such a simulation, and the resulting plots provide a direct visual validation of the model on a static network:\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\n(See the simulation script and accompanying plot below.)\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow, let’s provide the simulation code that generates the trajectory of B and C over time.Below is a concise answer addressing the questions:\\n\\n1. Final Attack Rate and R₀ Calculation:\\n\\nFor a homogeneous population, the final size (attack rate) is given by the implicit relation\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003S(∞)/N = exp[–R₀ · (1 – S(∞)/N)].\\n\\nWith an observed final fraction susceptible S(∞)/N = 0.33 (so about 67% infected), we have\\n\\n\\u2003\\u20030.33 = exp[–R₀ · (1 – 0.33)] = exp[–0.67R₀].\\n\\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003ln(0.33) = –0.67R₀  \\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = –(1/0.67)·ln(0.33).\\n\\nNumerically, ln(0.33) ≈ –1.10866 so that\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ ≈ (1.10866/0.67) ≈ 1.65.\\n\\nThus, an R₀ value of approximately 1.65 is required to yield a final attack rate close to 67%.\\n\\n2. Expected Peak Height and Timing for the B Compartment:\\n\\nBecause B (the “confined” compartment) results from a delay following infection (through compartments E and I) and then leaves at rate γ, its peak height and timing are determined by the interplay between the inflow (from I → B, which occurs at rate κ) and the outflow (from B → C, at rate γ).\\n\\nA practical guidance is as follows:\\n\\n\\u2003• In the early phase of an epidemic, the growth rate r is approximately determined by the linearized dynamics of the infection (and can be approximated by a function of β, κ, and, to a lesser extent, σ). Since only I is infectious, one might approximate r ≈ κ (R₀ – 1) for the exponential phase.\\n\\n\\u2003• The peak time for B essentially reflects the delay from infection to isolation plus the time when the epidemic’s exponential growth starts to slow. Roughly, one can expect the time of the peak in B to be near the sum of the mean latent period (≈ 1/σ) plus the mean time in the I compartment (≈ 1/κ) and some additional delay due to the finite width of the epidemic curve.\\n\\n\\u2003• The peak height in B can be approximated by balancing the maximum inflow from I to B (which is roughly κ times the number of individuals in I at peak) versus the removal rate γ. More formally, one would numerically integrate the ODE system (or perform a linear–analysis about the peak) to solve for when dB/dt = 0. In many cases, if the epidemic is well approximated by a Gaussian-like outbreak around the peak, the peak value of B is roughly proportional to\\n\\u2003\\u2003B_peak ≈ (κ/γ) · I_peak,\\nwhere I_peak itself depends on initial conditions and the growth dynamics.\\n\\nIn summary, while there is no simple closed‐form formula for the peak height and time in such a multi‐compartment model, they are governed by:\\n\\u2003– The delay multiplied by 1/σ and 1/κ which shift the epidemic in time,\\n\\u2003– The ratio κ/γ which affects the relative accumulation in B, and\\n\\u2003– The overall exponential growth rate r ≈ κ (R₀ – 1) during the early phase. \\n\\nThus, by setting σ (from external data), κ, and γ according to clinical data or fitting the observed B curve, one may numerically determine the time and magnitude of the peak in B.\\n\\n3. Summary:\\n\\n• To achieve a final attack rate of 67% (i.e. S(∞)/N=0.33), the final size equation requires R₀ ≈ 1.65.\\n• The expected peak height and timing of the B compartment are determined by the I → B rate κ and the B → C rate γ, with the approximate relationship for the initial exponential growth being r ≈ κ (R₀–1). The time delay from infection to confinement (roughly 1/σ + 1/κ) shifts the peak and the ratio κ/γ moderates the peak’s magnitude.\\n• In practice, simulation or numerical integration of the ODE model (or epidemic runs on a static network) is used to refine these estimates and capture the detailed behavior of the B compartment.\\n\\nThis completes the response with both the analytical calculation for R₀ and the guidance on extracting peak properties from the mechanistic model.To validate the analytical insight using a simulation on a static network, you would:\\n\\n1. Build a static contact network (e.g., an Erdős–Rényi graph) where each node (individual) can transition through the compartments S → E → I → B → C using exponentially distributed waiting times with rates σ (E→I), κ (I→B), and γ (B→C).\\n\\n2. Implement transmission only from the I compartment using a per-contact infection probability based on β. With only I transmitting, the effective R₀ is β/κ. Calibrate β so that, when the simulation is run over time, the cumulative number of infected individuals (ending in B then C) reaches approximately 67% of the network—that is, the final susceptible fraction is about 33%, consistent with the final size equation S(∞)/N = exp[–R₀·(1–S(∞)/N)]. The analytical solution shows that for S(∞)/N = 0.33, R₀ ≈ 1.65.\\n\\n3. Record the daily numbers of individuals in B and C during the simulation. Check that the B curve’s time profile—its rise, peak, and fall—matches expectations based on the delays introduced by the E→I (mean delay 1/σ) and I→B (mean delay 1/κ) transitions, and that the magnitude of the B compartment is shaped by the ratio κ/γ. In other words, the peak of B is roughly observed when the infection rate (influenced by κ(R₀–1)) starts to be balanced by the removal rate γ.\\n\\nThus, by comparing the simulation output (time series of B and C, final attack rate, and epidemic peak) to the predictions of the ODE model, you can validate that the mechanistic model over a static network reproduces the dynamics implied by the analytical relations.\\n\\nIn summary:\\n• Build and simulate the mechanistic epidemic model on a static network.\\n• Calibrate β (with κ fixed) so that R₀ = β/κ ≈ 1.65, matching the final size 0.33 susceptible (67% attack rate).\\n• Validate that the B and C curves (and the B peak’s height and timing, determined by κ and γ along with the latent delay 1/σ) align with your analytical predictions.\\n• This dual approach confirms both parameter identifiability from B and C data and the consistency between theory and epidemic simulation.')\nTo accomplish the task, the network and mechanistic model are designed as follows:\nEpidemicModelInfo(network_details='Network Structure: Complete undirected static contact network (K_763) representing the 1978 English Boarding School\\n- Nodes: 763 (students)\\n- Edges: Every possible node pair is connected (well-mixed, mean-field, hence |E| = N(N-1)/2 = 290,703)\\n- Degree distribution: All nodes have degree 762 (k=N-1), matching ODE-style well-mixed dynamics.

What Can Be Estimated from Daily B and C Data?\\n\\nSince only the time‐series data for B(t) and C(t) and the known population N are available, only those parameters that directly influence the observed trajectories can be uniquely “backed out” (provided one has a good model fit and reasonable model assumptions). In practice, one finds:\\n\\na) The “B‐curve” (the daily number in bed) is influenced by the follow‐up dynamics:\\n\\u2003• The I → B rate, κ, essentially governs the delay and timing with which infected individuals show up in the B compartment. (Its estimation comes from the time of the peak and the speed of ascent.)\\n\\u2003• The B → C rate, γ, is reflected in the “exit” from the B compartment (such as the decay tails of the B curve). Thus, γ can be estimated fairly directly via the rate at which the number of confined individuals leaves that compartment.\\n\\nb) Recovery (C) data provide an integral “output” of the epidemic. They are useful to calibrate the overall number of cases (the final attack rate) and to “anchor” the time integral of incidence. In particular, if one wishes the cumulative number of infections (B + C eventually, modulo any delays) to be around 67% of N, then one must pick the remaining parameters—the infection‐spreading part—such that the final size relation is satisfied.\\n\\nHowever, note that the unobserved compartments (E and I) and the infection process per se depend on both the transmission parameter β and the rates σ and κ. In many routine epidemic models (like an SEIR or its extensions), only *combinations* of parameters are identifiable from incidence curves. In our case, the following issues arise:\\n\\n• From the B and C data alone one can “pin down” κ and γ (given that the delay from I to B and the exit from B are seen in the shape of the B curve).  \\n• In contrast, σ (the rate of progression from exposed to infectious) is not uniquely determined by B and C when no E curve is available. Its value must typically be assumed or fixed based on prior biological knowledge.  \\n• Infection dynamics (and hence the overall epidemic size or final attack rate of around 67%) are determined by both the transmission parameter β and the average period that an individual spends in the infectious, non‐confined state (which is 1/κ). Typically only the combination (in particular, the product β · (1/κ)) is strongly identifiable through the exponential growth rate in the early phase and via the final size equation.\\n\\nThus, from the available data one can uniquely estimate (or fit) the “observable” transition B → C (γ) and aspects of the delay I → B (κ) and even the product β/κ (which then fixes R₀ given the final attack rate). But σ remains non‐identifiable unless we assume (or fix) its value from external data. Similarly, initial conditions in the hidden compartments (E and I) must be assumed to be “small” or fixed at the onset of the epidemic.\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\n3. Fitting the Model to the B Curve and Matching a 67% Final Attack Rate\\n\\n(a) Fitting the B (bed confinement) curve:\\n\\u2003• You would integrate the model ODEs and adjust parameters to match the daily number in B.\\n\\u2003• The timing and shape of the B curve are strongly influenced by κ and γ. It is common to assume the latent period (1/σ) from other epidemiological data.\\n\\u2003• You might fix σ from literature (e.g., 1/σ ≈ 3–5 days) and then adjust κ to capture the onset of symptomatic (confinement) cases, while γ is estimated from the B→C transition dynamics.\\n\\n(b) Matching a final attack rate of ~67% (i.e. final cumulative infected ≈0.67N):\\n\\u2003• The cumulative number of individuals infected (i.e. who have passed through E, I, and B and ended in C, plus possibly those still in B) is determined by the basic reproduction number R₀.  \\n\\u2003• Using the final-size relation (which, for standard SIR-like dynamics, satisfies S(∞)/N = exp[–R₀ (1 – S(∞)/N)]), you can “back-calculate” the needed R₀ value (and hence the ratio β/κ) to yield a final fraction infected of about 0.67.\\n\\u2003• Thus, one adjusts β (if κ is already estimated) so that the solution of the equations yields S(∞)/N ≈ 0.33.  \\n\\u2003• Note that this procedure implicitly assumes that the “core” epidemic dynamics (S, E, I dynamics) follow the simple ordinary differential equations with no additional external forcing.\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\n4. Equation for R₀\\n\\nUnder the assumptions that only the “I” compartment is responsible for transmission and that infected individuals spend an average time (1/κ) in the highly infectious I\\xa0state, the basic reproduction number R₀ is given by\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = (β / κ)\\n\\nHere, β is the effective transmission parameter (that is, the rate at which an infectious individual makes sufficient contact to infect a susceptible person) and 1/κ is the average duration in the undetected infectious state. (This is under the assumption that no further transmission occurs from the individuals once they enter B because they are confined.) If one wished to refine the definition by including a nonzero contribution from later compartments or delay due to the latent period, then one would have to include that effect; however, given the assumed structure (E not being infectious, B not transmitting) the above formula is appropriate.\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\n5. Assumptions Required\\n\\nTo uniquely determine the parameters from the observed B and C data, one must assume:\\n\\u2003• That the structure of the transmission model is correct (e.g. that only I is infectious and that B are effectively isolated).  \\n\\u2003• Known (or assumed) values for the latent period (1/σ) from external studies.  \\n\\u2003• Homogeneous mixing and a closed population (N is known and no new individuals enter or leave, except via infection/recovery).  \\n\\u2003• That the recording of B and C is essentially complete (i.e. no systematic under-reporting or delays not modeled by the transitions).  \\n\\u2003• That the various rates do not change with time (i.e. constant parameters) so that the observed developments uniquely reflect the dynamics.\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\n6. Summary Answer\\n\\n• The observed B and C data allow you to uniquely estimate those parameters that govern the transitions which directly “feed into” the observed quantities: notably, κ (the I→B rate) and γ (the B→C rate).  \\n• The estimation of σ (E→I rate) is not unique unless you assume a value based on prior knowledge, because the E compartment is never directly observed.  \\n• In addition, the transmission parameter β is only identifiable up to the combination β/κ since only the product (determining the effective reproduction number R₀) matters for the epidemic growth and final size.  \\n• To reproduce a final attack rate (total infection) of about 67% you must choose β (given κ) so that the effective reproduction number (and hence the final size given by S(∞)/N = exp[–R₀ (1 – S(∞)/N)]) yields approximately 67% of the population infected.  \\n• Finally, under the assumptions made (that only the I compartment is infectious), the basic reproduction number R₀ is given by\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = β/κ .\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\nThis analysis explains the identifiability of the model and the assumptions required. It also explains how to fit the B curve and tune the model to achieve the target final attack rate.Below is a concise answer that ties together the analytical identifiability with simulation‐based validation on static networks:\\n\\n1. You first specify the mechanistic S → E → I → B → C process on a static network (e.g., an Erdős–Rényi or similar network) where nodes represent individuals and edges reflect contacts. Transition times from E → I, I → B, and B → C are simulated as exponentially distributed waiting times using the rates σ, κ, and γ respectively. Only the I compartment is “active” in transmitting the infection along edges with infection probability related to β.\\n\\n2. In validating the analytical solution using simulation, you:\\n\\u2003• Reproduce the B (confined) and C (recovery) time series by running the simulation and aggregating the compartment counts at each time step.\\n\\u2003• Confirm that the simulated B curve’s timing and shape match the parameter–driven delays (of κ and γ).\\n\\u2003• Adjust β (and hence the effective reproduction number R₀ = β/κ) so that the final fraction of infected individuals (final attack rate, summed over B and C) is around 67%.\\n\\u2003• Compare these outputs with the ODE model predictions (using the same parameters) to ensure that the observable dynamics from the simulation are in line with the model’s identifiability assumptions.\\n\\n3. In this way, by performing simulation on a network, you validate that only the parameters related to transitions into the observable states (κ and γ, and the combination β/κ) can be uniquely calibrated from B and C data, while σ must be externally fixed.\\n\\nThe following Python code snippet (saved in a script named “simulate-epidemic-network.py”) demonstrates such a simulation, and the resulting plots provide a direct visual validation of the model on a static network:\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\n(See the simulation script and accompanying plot below.)\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow, let’s provide the simulation code that generates the trajectory of B and C over time.Below is a concise answer addressing the questions:\\n\\n1. Final Attack Rate and R₀ Calculation:\\n\\nFor a homogeneous population, the final size (attack rate) is given by the implicit relation\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003S(∞)/N = exp[–R₀ · (1 – S(∞)/N)].\\n\\nWith an observed final fraction susceptible S(∞)/N = 0.33 (so about 67% infected), we have\\n\\n\\u2003\\u20030.33 = exp[–R₀ · (1 – 0.33)] = exp[–0.67R₀].\\n\\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003ln(0.33) = –0.67R₀  \\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = –(1/0.67)·ln(0.33).\\n\\nNumerically, ln(0.33) ≈ –1.10866 so that\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ ≈ (1.10866/0.67) ≈ 1.65.\\n\\nThus, an R₀ value of approximately 1.65 is required to yield a final attack rate close to 67%.\\n\\n2. Expected Peak Height and Timing for the B Compartment:\\n\\nBecause B (the “confined” compartment) results from a delay following infection (through compartments E and I) and then leaves at rate γ, its peak height and timing are determined by the interplay between the inflow (from I → B, which occurs at rate κ) and the outflow (from B → C, at rate γ).\\n\\nA practical guidance is as follows:\\n\\n\\u2003• In the early phase of an epidemic, the growth rate r is approximately determined by the linearized dynamics of the infection (and can be approximated by a function of β, κ, and, to a lesser extent, σ). Since only I is infectious, one might approximate r ≈ κ (R₀ – 1) for the exponential phase.\\n\\n\\u2003• The peak time for B essentially reflects the delay from infection to isolation plus the time when the epidemic’s exponential growth starts to slow. Roughly, one can expect the time of the peak in B to be near the sum of the mean latent period (≈ 1/σ) plus the mean time in the I compartment (≈ 1/κ) and some additional delay due to the finite width of the epidemic curve.\\n\\n\\u2003• The peak height in B can be approximated by balancing the maximum inflow from I to B (which is roughly κ times the number of individuals in I at peak) versus the removal rate γ. More formally, one would numerically integrate the ODE system (or perform a linear–analysis about the peak) to solve for when dB/dt = 0. In many cases, if the epidemic is well approximated by a Gaussian-like outbreak around the peak, the peak value of B is roughly proportional to\\n\\u2003\\u2003B_peak ≈ (κ/γ) · I_peak,\\nwhere I_peak itself depends on initial conditions and the growth dynamics.\\n\\nIn summary, while there is no simple closed‐form formula for the peak height and time in such a multi‐compartment model, they are governed by:\\n\\u2003– The delay multiplied by 1/σ and 1/κ which shift the epidemic in time,\\n\\u2003– The ratio κ/γ which affects the relative accumulation in B, and\\n\\u2003– The overall exponential growth rate r ≈ κ (R₀ – 1) during the early phase. \\n\\nThus, by setting σ (from external data), κ, and γ according to clinical data or fitting the observed B curve, one may numerically determine the time and magnitude of the peak in B.\\n\\n3. Summary:\\n\\n• To achieve a final attack rate of 67% (i.e. S(∞)/N=0.33), the final size equation requires R₀ ≈ 1.65.\\n• The expected peak height and timing of the B compartment are determined by the I → B rate κ and the B → C rate γ, with the approximate relationship for the initial exponential growth being r ≈ κ (R₀–1). The time delay from infection to confinement (roughly 1/σ + 1/κ) shifts the peak and the ratio κ/γ moderates the peak’s magnitude.\\n• In practice, simulation or numerical integration of the ODE model (or epidemic runs on a static network) is used to refine these estimates and capture the detailed behavior of the B compartment.\\n\\nThis completes the response with both the analytical calculation for R₀ and the guidance on extracting peak properties from the mechanistic model.To validate the analytical insight using a simulation on a static network, you would:\\n\\n1. Build a static contact network (e.g., an Erdős–Rényi graph) where each node (individual) can transition through the compartments S → E → I → B → C using exponentially distributed waiting times with rates σ (E→I), κ (I→B), and γ (B→C).\\n\\n2. Implement transmission only from the I compartment using a per-contact infection probability based on β. With only I transmitting, the effective R₀ is β/κ. Calibrate β so that, when the simulation is run over time, the cumulative number of infected individuals (ending in B then C) reaches approximately 67% of the network—that is, the final susceptible fraction is about 33%, consistent with the final size equation S(∞)/N = exp[–R₀·(1–S(∞)/N)]. The analytical solution shows that for S(∞)/N = 0.33, R₀ ≈ 1.65.\\n\\n3. Record the daily numbers of individuals in B and C during the simulation. Check that the B curve’s time profile—its rise, peak, and fall—matches expectations based on the delays introduced by the E→I (mean delay 1/σ) and I→B (mean delay 1/κ) transitions, and that the magnitude of the B compartment is shaped by the ratio κ/γ. In other words, the peak of B is roughly observed when the infection rate (influenced by κ(R₀–1)) starts to be balanced by the removal rate γ.\\n\\nThus, by comparing the simulation output (time series of B and C, final attack rate, and epidemic peak) to the predictions of the ODE model, you can validate that the mechanistic model over a static network reproduces the dynamics implied by the analytical relations.\\n\\nIn summary:\\n• Build and simulate the mechanistic epidemic model on a static network.\\n• Calibrate β (with κ fixed) so that R₀ = β/κ ≈ 1.65, matching the final size 0.33 susceptible (67% attack rate).\\n• Validate that the B and C curves (and the B peak’s height and timing, determined by κ and γ along with the latent delay 1/σ) align with your analytical predictions.\\n• This dual approach confirms both parameter identifiability from B and C data and the consistency between theory and epidemic simulation.').\nTo accomplish the task, the network and mechanistic model are designed as follows:\nEpidemicModelInfo(network_details='Network Structure: Complete undirected static contact network (K_763) representing the 1978 English Boarding School\\n- Nodes: 763 (students)\\n- Edges: Every possible node pair is connected (well-mixed, mean-field, hence |E| = N(N-1)/2 = 290,703)\\n- Degree distribution: All nodes have degree 762 (k=N-1), matching ODE-style well-mixed dynamics.

Defining Baseline and Comparison Scenarios\n### 1.1 Baseline scenario (i=1, j=1):\n- **Network:** Complete graph of 763 nodes, loaded as scipy CSR from network-complete.npz.\n- **Initial condition:** 1 initial I, 762 S, all other compartments 0.\n- **Model parameters:**  \n    - β = 1.65  \n    - σ = 1.0 (latent, 1 day)  \n    - κ = 1.0 (infectious, 1 day)  \n    - γ = 0.3333 (bed, 3 days)  \n  ⇒ R₀ = β / κ = 1.65 (matches attack rate analytic).\n    - **Initial compartment mapping:** X0: all 0s, X0[chosen initial node]=2 (I compartment, code 0:S, 1:E, 2:I, 3:B, 4:C)\n- **Number of stochastic realizations:** nsim (100–300), chosen so mean and spread are converged and runtime is acceptable.\n- **Stop condition:** Sufficient to capture entire epidemic (>40 days).\n- **Outputs:** Save both result CSV and plot for B and C time series.\n- **Variation metric:** 90% confidence intervals (CI) across realizations and plot.\n\n### 1.2 Parameter Variation Scenarios:\nTo assess identifiability, robustness, and fit:\n#### (i=1, j=2): σ = 0.5 (latent period = 2 days)\n- Keep β, κ, γ fixed, only increase latent period.\n\n#### (i=1, j=3): κ = 0.5 (infectious period = 2 days), adjust β to keep R₀=1.65 (i.e., β = 0.825)\n- Examines sensitivity to infectious duration under same final size.\n\n#### (i=1, j=4): γ = 0.5 (bed period = 2 days)  \n#### (i=1, j=5): γ = 0.25 (bed period = 4 days)\n- Test the model's ability to match bed-curve shape by refining bed-confinement duration.\n\n#### (i=1, j=6): σ = 0.5, κ = 0.5, γ = 0.3333, β = 0.825\n- Multi-parameter low-rate scenario, matches R₀, changes internal delays.\n\n## 2. Simulation Setup Details\n### 2.1 Mechanistic Model Coding for FastGEMF\n- **Define compartments:** 'S', 'E', 'I', 'B', 'C'\n- **Transitions:**  \n    - S -(I)-> E, rate β  (edge-based, only 'I' can induce infection)\n    - E → I, rate σ (node-based)\n    - I → B, rate κ (node-based)\n    - B → C, rate γ (node-based)\n- **ModelSchema:** Define compartment order and all transitions with correct rates and inducers.\n\n### 2.2 Network Loading and Configuration\n- Load network as CSR matrix from network-complete.npz using scipy.\n- Set as 'contact_network_layer' in FastGEMF.\n\n### 2.3 Initial Condition Array\n- All nodes start S (code 0), except one I (code 2). Randomly choose node.\n- Construct X0 for 'exact' initial condition.\n\n### 2.4 Running the Simulation\n- For each (i, j) scenario:\n    - Set parameters.\n    - Use initial condition and ModelSchema to build Configuration.\n    - Run FastGEMF Simulation (nsim > 100; check convergence).\n    - Save as described.\n\n### 2.5 Output Handling\n- Save results as os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'output', f'results-{i}{j}.csv')\n- Save plot as os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'output', f'results-{i}{j}.png')\n- Ensure B and C time series are included and marked.\n- Provide clear captions/legends.\n\n## 3. Scenario Variations, Extensive Testing, and Quality Assurance\n### 3.1 Ensuring Insightful Results\n- Each parameter variation is chosen for biological and identifiability reasons (latent, infectious, bed durations).\n- Each run: check that B(t) matches data in shape, timing, peak, and that attack rate is ≈67%.\n- Compare simulated and observed B curves for discrepancies.\n\n### 3.2 Robustness and Verification\n- For each run, check:\n    - Did at least 66% of population enter B and C combined?\n    - Is B(t) peak and timing plausible and close to outbreak data?\n    - Do confidence intervals capture observed fluctuation?\n- If not: either increase nsim or refine parameter scan around the baseline values.\n\n- Capture simulated peak time and value for B; calculate final attack rate from final C (and possibly B) counts.\n- Save these summary statistics for each scenario to CSV for reporting.\n\n## 4. Execution Integrity\n- Scripts for each scenario named 'simulation-ij.py'.\n- Each code block must:\n    - Load the correct network and parameters for the scenario.\n    - Write outputs with no print(), as specified.\n    - Check (and report during sim) the fraction of population that entered B and C to cross-check final attack rate.\n- For convergence issues (excess spread or not enough infected): adjust nsim, rerun, or review parameters.\n\n## 5. Additional Tasks and Edge Cases\n- If data path for observed B(t) exists, use pandas to import and (optionally) plot for side-by-side comparison (visual/checking only).\n- If for some reason FastGEMF fails (network format, etc.), drop down to ODE implementation as backup, and comment reasoning for change.\n- All files saved in /output/, no stray outputs.\n- Summarize and store all scenario outputs and plots with concise captions, as required.\n\n───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n**Summary:**  \nWe will perform a series of mechanistic stochastic simulations of the SEIBC model for the 1978 English boarding school outbreak, over the provided complete static contact network.

What Can Be Estimated from Daily B and C Data?\\n\\nSince only the time‐series data for B(t) and C(t) and the known population N are available, only those parameters that directly influence the observed trajectories can be uniquely “backed out” (provided one has a good model fit and reasonable model assumptions). In practice, one finds:\\n\\na) The “B‐curve” (the daily number in bed) is influenced by the follow‐up dynamics:\\n\\u2003• The I → B rate, κ, essentially governs the delay and timing with which infected individuals show up in the B compartment. (Its estimation comes from the time of the peak and the speed of ascent.)\\n\\u2003• The B → C rate, γ, is reflected in the “exit” from the B compartment (such as the decay tails of the B curve). Thus, γ can be estimated fairly directly via the rate at which the number of confined individuals leaves that compartment.\\n\\nb) Recovery (C) data provide an integral “output” of the epidemic. They are useful to calibrate the overall number of cases (the final attack rate) and to “anchor” the time integral of incidence. In particular, if one wishes the cumulative number of infections (B + C eventually, modulo any delays) to be around 67% of N, then one must pick the remaining parameters—the infection‐spreading part—such that the final size relation is satisfied.\\n\\nHowever, note that the unobserved compartments (E and I) and the infection process per se depend on both the transmission parameter β and the rates σ and κ. In many routine epidemic models (like an SEIR or its extensions), only *combinations* of parameters are identifiable from incidence curves. In our case, the following issues arise:\\n\\n• From the B and C data alone one can “pin down” κ and γ (given that the delay from I to B and the exit from B are seen in the shape of the B curve).  \\n• In contrast, σ (the rate of progression from exposed to infectious) is not uniquely determined by B and C when no E curve is available. Its value must typically be assumed or fixed based on prior biological knowledge.  \\n• Infection dynamics (and hence the overall epidemic size or final attack rate of around 67%) are determined by both the transmission parameter β and the average period that an individual spends in the infectious, non‐confined state (which is 1/κ). Typically only the combination (in particular, the product β · (1/κ)) is strongly identifiable through the exponential growth rate in the early phase and via the final size equation.\\n\\nThus, from the available data one can uniquely estimate (or fit) the “observable” transition B → C (γ) and aspects of the delay I → B (κ) and even the product β/κ (which then fixes R₀ given the final attack rate). But σ remains non‐identifiable unless we assume (or fix) its value from external data. Similarly, initial conditions in the hidden compartments (E and I) must be assumed to be “small” or fixed at the onset of the epidemic.\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\n3. Fitting the Model to the B Curve and Matching a 67% Final Attack Rate\\n\\n(a) Fitting the B (bed confinement) curve:\\n\\u2003• You would integrate the model ODEs and adjust parameters to match the daily number in B.\\n\\u2003• The timing and shape of the B curve are strongly influenced by κ and γ. It is common to assume the latent period (1/σ) from other epidemiological data.\\n\\u2003• You might fix σ from literature (e.g., 1/σ ≈ 3–5 days) and then adjust κ to capture the onset of symptomatic (confinement) cases, while γ is estimated from the B→C transition dynamics.\\n\\n(b) Matching a final attack rate of ~67% (i.e. final cumulative infected ≈0.67N):\\n\\u2003• The cumulative number of individuals infected (i.e. who have passed through E, I, and B and ended in C, plus possibly those still in B) is determined by the basic reproduction number R₀.  \\n\\u2003• Using the final-size relation (which, for standard SIR-like dynamics, satisfies S(∞)/N = exp[–R₀ (1 – S(∞)/N)]), you can “back-calculate” the needed R₀ value (and hence the ratio β/κ) to yield a final fraction infected of about 0.67.\\n\\u2003• Thus, one adjusts β (if κ is already estimated) so that the solution of the equations yields S(∞)/N ≈ 0.33.  \\n\\u2003• Note that this procedure implicitly assumes that the “core” epidemic dynamics (S, E, I dynamics) follow the simple ordinary differential equations with no additional external forcing.\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\n4. Equation for R₀\\n\\nUnder the assumptions that only the “I” compartment is responsible for transmission and that infected individuals spend an average time (1/κ) in the highly infectious I\\xa0state, the basic reproduction number R₀ is given by\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = (β / κ)\\n\\nHere, β is the effective transmission parameter (that is, the rate at which an infectious individual makes sufficient contact to infect a susceptible person) and 1/κ is the average duration in the undetected infectious state. (This is under the assumption that no further transmission occurs from the individuals once they enter B because they are confined.) If one wished to refine the definition by including a nonzero contribution from later compartments or delay due to the latent period, then one would have to include that effect; however, given the assumed structure (E not being infectious, B not transmitting) the above formula is appropriate.\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\n5. Assumptions Required\\n\\nTo uniquely determine the parameters from the observed B and C data, one must assume:\\n\\u2003• That the structure of the transmission model is correct (e.g. that only I is infectious and that B are effectively isolated).  \\n\\u2003• Known (or assumed) values for the latent period (1/σ) from external studies.  \\n\\u2003• Homogeneous mixing and a closed population (N is known and no new individuals enter or leave, except via infection/recovery).  \\n\\u2003• That the recording of B and C is essentially complete (i.e. no systematic under-reporting or delays not modeled by the transitions).  \\n\\u2003• That the various rates do not change with time (i.e. constant parameters) so that the observed developments uniquely reflect the dynamics.\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\n6. Summary Answer\\n\\n• The observed B and C data allow you to uniquely estimate those parameters that govern the transitions which directly “feed into” the observed quantities: notably, κ (the I→B rate) and γ (the B→C rate).  \\n• The estimation of σ (E→I rate) is not unique unless you assume a value based on prior knowledge, because the E compartment is never directly observed.  \\n• In addition, the transmission parameter β is only identifiable up to the combination β/κ since only the product (determining the effective reproduction number R₀) matters for the epidemic growth and final size.  \\n• To reproduce a final attack rate (total infection) of about 67% you must choose β (given κ) so that the effective reproduction number (and hence the final size given by S(∞)/N = exp[–R₀ (1 – S(∞)/N)]) yields approximately 67% of the population infected.  \\n• Finally, under the assumptions made (that only the I compartment is infectious), the basic reproduction number R₀ is given by\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = β/κ .\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\nThis analysis explains the identifiability of the model and the assumptions required. It also explains how to fit the B curve and tune the model to achieve the target final attack rate.Below is a concise answer that ties together the analytical identifiability with simulation‐based validation on static networks:\\n\\n1. You first specify the mechanistic S → E → I → B → C process on a static network (e.g., an Erdős–Rényi or similar network) where nodes represent individuals and edges reflect contacts. Transition times from E → I, I → B, and B → C are simulated as exponentially distributed waiting times using the rates σ, κ, and γ respectively. Only the I compartment is “active” in transmitting the infection along edges with infection probability related to β.\\n\\n2. In validating the analytical solution using simulation, you:\\n\\u2003• Reproduce the B (confined) and C (recovery) time series by running the simulation and aggregating the compartment counts at each time step.\\n\\u2003• Confirm that the simulated B curve’s timing and shape match the parameter–driven delays (of κ and γ).\\n\\u2003• Adjust β (and hence the effective reproduction number R₀ = β/κ) so that the final fraction of infected individuals (final attack rate, summed over B and C) is around 67%.\\n\\u2003• Compare these outputs with the ODE model predictions (using the same parameters) to ensure that the observable dynamics from the simulation are in line with the model’s identifiability assumptions.\\n\\n3. In this way, by performing simulation on a network, you validate that only the parameters related to transitions into the observable states (κ and γ, and the combination β/κ) can be uniquely calibrated from B and C data, while σ must be externally fixed.\\n\\nThe following Python code snippet (saved in a script named “simulate-epidemic-network.py”) demonstrates such a simulation, and the resulting plots provide a direct visual validation of the model on a static network:\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\n(See the simulation script and accompanying plot below.)\\n---------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow, let’s provide the simulation code that generates the trajectory of B and C over time.Below is a concise answer addressing the questions:\\n\\n1. Final Attack Rate and R₀ Calculation:\\n\\nFor a homogeneous population, the final size (attack rate) is given by the implicit relation\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003S(∞)/N = exp[–R₀ · (1 – S(∞)/N)].\\n\\nWith an observed final fraction susceptible S(∞)/N = 0.33 (so about 67% infected), we have\\n\\n\\u2003\\u20030.33 = exp[–R₀ · (1 – 0.33)] = exp[–0.67R₀].\\n\\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003ln(0.33) = –0.67R₀  \\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = –(1/0.67)·ln(0.33).\\n\\nNumerically, ln(0.33) ≈ –1.10866 so that\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ ≈ (1.10866/0.67) ≈ 1.65.\\n\\nThus, an R₀ value of approximately 1.65 is required to yield a final attack rate close to 67%.\\n\\n2. Expected Peak Height and Timing for the B Compartment:\\n\\nBecause B (the “confined” compartment) results from a delay following infection (through compartments E and I) and then leaves at rate γ, its peak height and timing are determined by the interplay between the inflow (from I → B, which occurs at rate κ) and the outflow (from B → C, at rate γ).\\n\\nA practical guidance is as follows:\\n\\n\\u2003• In the early phase of an epidemic, the growth rate r is approximately determined by the linearized dynamics of the infection (and can be approximated by a function of β, κ, and, to a lesser extent, σ). Since only I is infectious, one might approximate r ≈ κ (R₀ – 1) for the exponential phase.\\n\\n\\u2003• The peak time for B essentially reflects the delay from infection to isolation plus the time when the epidemic’s exponential growth starts to slow. Roughly, one can expect the time of the peak in B to be near the sum of the mean latent period (≈ 1/σ) plus the mean time in the I compartment (≈ 1/κ) and some additional delay due to the finite width of the epidemic curve.\\n\\n\\u2003• The peak height in B can be approximated by balancing the maximum inflow from I to B (which is roughly κ times the number of individuals in I at peak) versus the removal rate γ. More formally, one would numerically integrate the ODE system (or perform a linear–analysis about the peak) to solve for when dB/dt = 0. In many cases, if the epidemic is well approximated by a Gaussian-like outbreak around the peak, the peak value of B is roughly proportional to\\n\\u2003\\u2003B_peak ≈ (κ/γ) · I_peak,\\nwhere I_peak itself depends on initial conditions and the growth dynamics.\\n\\nIn summary, while there is no simple closed‐form formula for the peak height and time in such a multi‐compartment model, they are governed by:\\n\\u2003– The delay multiplied by 1/σ and 1/κ which shift the epidemic in time,\\n\\u2003– The ratio κ/γ which affects the relative accumulation in B, and\\n\\u2003– The overall exponential growth rate r ≈ κ (R₀ – 1) during the early phase. \\n\\nThus, by setting σ (from external data), κ, and γ according to clinical data or fitting the observed B curve, one may numerically determine the time and magnitude of the peak in B.\\n\\n3. Summary:\\n\\n• To achieve a final attack rate of 67% (i.e. S(∞)/N=0.33), the final size equation requires R₀ ≈ 1.65.\\n• The expected peak height and timing of the B compartment are determined by the I → B rate κ and the B → C rate γ, with the approximate relationship for the initial exponential growth being r ≈ κ (R₀–1). The time delay from infection to confinement (roughly 1/σ + 1/κ) shifts the peak and the ratio κ/γ moderates the peak’s magnitude.\\n• In practice, simulation or numerical integration of the ODE model (or epidemic runs on a static network) is used to refine these estimates and capture the detailed behavior of the B compartment.\\n\\nThis completes the response with both the analytical calculation for R₀ and the guidance on extracting peak properties from the mechanistic model.To validate the analytical insight using a simulation on a static network, you would:\\n\\n1. Build a static contact network (e.g., an Erdős–Rényi graph) where each node (individual) can transition through the compartments S → E → I → B → C using exponentially distributed waiting times with rates σ (E→I), κ (I→B), and γ (B→C).\\n\\n2. Implement transmission only from the I compartment using a per-contact infection probability based on β. With only I transmitting, the effective R₀ is β/κ. Calibrate β so that, when the simulation is run over time, the cumulative number of infected individuals (ending in B then C) reaches approximately 67% of the network—that is, the final susceptible fraction is about 33%, consistent with the final size equation S(∞)/N = exp[–R₀·(1–S(∞)/N)]. The analytical solution shows that for S(∞)/N = 0.33, R₀ ≈ 1.65.\\n\\n3. Record the daily numbers of individuals in B and C during the simulation. Check that the B curve’s time profile—its rise, peak, and fall—matches expectations based on the delays introduced by the E→I (mean delay 1/σ) and I→B (mean delay 1/κ) transitions, and that the magnitude of the B compartment is shaped by the ratio κ/γ. In other words, the peak of B is roughly observed when the infection rate (influenced by κ(R₀–1)) starts to be balanced by the removal rate γ.\\n\\nThus, by comparing the simulation output (time series of B and C, final attack rate, and epidemic peak) to the predictions of the ODE model, you can validate that the mechanistic model over a static network reproduces the dynamics implied by the analytical relations.\\n\\nIn summary:\\n• Build and simulate the mechanistic epidemic model on a static network.\\n• Calibrate β (with κ fixed) so that R₀ = β/κ ≈ 1.65, matching the final size 0.33 susceptible (67% attack rate).\\n• Validate that the B and C curves (and the B peak’s height and timing, determined by κ and γ along with the latent delay 1/σ) align with your analytical predictions.\\n• This dual approach confirms both parameter identifiability from B and C data and the consistency between theory and epidemic simulation.').\nTo accomplish the task, the network and mechanistic model are designed as follows:\nEpidemicModelInfo(network_details='Network Structure: Complete undirected static contact network (K_763) representing the 1978 English Boarding School\\n- Nodes: 763 (students)\\n- Edges: Every possible node pair is connected (well-mixed, mean-field, hence |E| = N(N-1)/2 = 290,703)\\n- Degree distribution: All nodes have degree 762 (k=N-1), matching ODE-style well-mixed dynamics.
