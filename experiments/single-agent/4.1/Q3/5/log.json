We simulate networks with 1000 nodes, where each node activates with probability $\\alpha=0.1$ per time step and forms $m=2$ transient links. By contrasting SIR spreading on both the empirical temporal network (represented by its weighted time-aggregated form) and an unweighted static reference built to match mean degree, we quantify differences in final epidemic size, outbreak duration, and infection dynamics. Our findings underscore the profound effects of temporal ordering and burstiness of contacts: the static network dramatically underestimates both outbreak speed and total epidemic size. Results are contextualized within current literature on time-varying networks and epidemic thresholds.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe intricate interplay between network structure and epidemic dynamics has been a subject of intense research \\cite{Nadini2020,HolmeSaramaki2012,MasudaHolme2013}. While time-aggregated static networks provide a baseline for understanding broad connectivity patterns, recent work demonstrates that the temporal sequence of interactions---who meets whom, and when---imposes strict causal constraints affecting disease transmission and control \\cite{HolmeSaramaki2012}. Activity-driven models, as introduced by Perra et al., allow each node a probabilistic schedule of activations, which creates fleeting, memoryless links wherein the network topology is reconstituted at each time step \\cite{Nadini2020}. This temporal complexity leads to significant differences in how diseases, modeled for example by the classical SIR framework, unfold compared to their spread over time-aggregated static versions of the same networks \\cite{MasudaHolme2013,Starnini2013}.\n\nHere, we empirically and computationally address: in an activity-driven temporal network with $N=1000$, $\\alpha=0.1$, and $m=2$, how does the epidemic trajectory (final size, duration, speed) compare for SIR spread (with $R_0=3$) when run over the authentic temporal pattern versus the equivalent static time-aggregated network weighted by contact frequency? What shortcomings does the static representation exhibit, and what are the theoretical and practical consequences for understanding real-world epidemics?\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\textbf{Network Construction:} The activity-driven temporal network was synthesized as follows: each of $N=1000$ nodes could activate with probability $\\alpha=0.1$ per time step, forming $m=2$ links to random others. Over $T=1000$ steps, every transient link was recorded. The time-aggregated static weighted network was then built by assigning edge weights proportional to the frequency of each pair's temporal contacts per unit time. For comparison, an unweighted static network was assembled using the highest-frequency contacts to match the mean degree, $\\langle k \\rangle = 0.4$.\n\n\\textbf{SIR Model and Parameters:} The epidemic was simulated on both network types using a node-level stochastic SIR process (states: Susceptible, Infected, Recovered). Key rates were derived from $R_0=3$, with $\\gamma=0.2$ and $\\beta=1.64$ (static network, adjusted to degree distribution). Initial conditions randomly seeded 1\\% of nodes as infected, the remainder as susceptible.\n\n\\textbf{Simulation and Observables:} Each scenario was simulated for up to 100 virtual time units, recording $S(t)$, $I(t)$, $R(t)$ over time. The main observables are: peak infection fraction, time to peak, final epidemic size ($R(\\infty)$), and epidemic duration (time until $I(t)<0.001$).\n\nRelevant network statistics: aggregated (weighted) degree mean $\\langle k \\rangle \\approx 330$, $\\langle k^2 \\rangle \\approx 109121$; unweighted static $\\langle k \\rangle =0.4$, $\\langle k^2 \\rangle = 0.546$.\n\nFigures: Degree distributions (Fig.~\\ref{fig:degree-dist}) and SIR epidemic curves (Fig.~\\ref{fig:SIR-curves}) were plotted for illustration.\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\linewidth]{figure-degree-dist.png}\n\\caption{Degree distribution for the aggregated weighted and static unweighted networks. Note the dramatic difference in connectivities.}\n\\label{fig:degree-dist}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{figure-compare-static-agg.png}\n\\caption{SIR epidemic curves on static (unweighted) and aggregated (weighted) activity-driven networks. Solid lines: $I(t)$; dashed: $R(t)$.}\n\\label{fig:SIR-curves}\n\\end{figure}\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:metrics} summarizes key metrics.\n\n\\begin{table}[htbp]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Epidemic metrics: static vs aggregated networks}\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccc}\n\\hline\nNetwork & Peak $I$ & $t_\\mathrm{peak}$ & Final size $R(\\infty)$ & Duration \\\\\n\\hline\nStatic unweighted & 0.012 & 0.39 & 0.015 & 10.3 \\\\\nAggregated weighted & 0.308 & 11.94 & 0.951 & 51.1 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{tab:metrics}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe time-aggregated (weighted) network produced a dramatically higher and later infection peak, longer epidemic duration, and almost the entire population was ultimately affected, whereas the reference static network saw only a minor early outbreak. Plots confirm that static representations greatly understate epidemic potential.\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nThe static network, despite being derived via the most frequent contacts to match the mean degree, failed to reproduce the outbreak scale and duration observed in the temporally aggregated (weighted) network. This underestimation is attributable to the omission of temporal correlation patterns---most notably, the simultaneous occurrence of events (concurrency), causal contact ordering, burstiness in tie activity, and repeated contacts---that characterize dynamic social systems \\cite{MasudaHolme2013,HolmeSaramaki2012}. Such patterns can either inhibit or accelerate epidemic spread depending on how they (de)couple infection opportunity from network topology \\cite{Starnini2013}.\n\nOur simulations reinforce previous findings that static graphs poorly predict real epidemic reach and timing, even when edge weights reflect empirical contact frequency \\cite{Nadini2020}. Only cumulative metrics like average degree---not temporal order or recurrence intervals---inform the static structure, leaving it blind to effects that can elongate chains of infection and thus fuel larger outbreaks. The difference is especially acute in the activity-driven regime, which lacks persistent (long-memory) edges, making the time-aggregated network much denser than a static degree-matched random graph. These results align with recent theoretical and empirical work showing lower epidemic thresholds and greater vulnerability in temporal and activity-driven networks, unless strong memory effects localize transmission \\cite{Nadini2020}.\n\\section{Conclusion}\nOur study quantitatively demonstrates that temporal structure, as opposed to static aggregation, exerts a profound influence on the spread of infectious diseases in activity-driven networks. Simplified static models, even when augmented by frequency-based weights, consistently underestimate the true risk and scope of outbreaks. These findings argue for caution when employing network aggregation in epidemic modeling, especially for fast-spreading diseases on rapidly changing contact graphs. Future work will explore temporal-respecting intervention strategies built on these insights.\n\n\\section*{References}\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\n\\bibitem{Nadini2020} Matthieu Nadini, A.
