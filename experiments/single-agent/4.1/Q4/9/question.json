Beta 1 and delta 1 for layer 1 and beta2 and delta 2 for layer 2 Assume the effective infection rates of each virus are larger than their no-spreading mean field threshold, i.e., 𝜏1>1/𝜆1(𝐴) and 𝜏2>1/𝜆1(𝐵).Question1-:  Will both viruses survive (coexistence), or will one virus completely remove the other (absolute dominance)?2-which characteristics of a multilayer network structure allow for coexistence?",
