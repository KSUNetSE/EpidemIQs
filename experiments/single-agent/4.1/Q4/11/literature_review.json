                    "abstract": "The summary measurement of an epidemic such as the final size is an important quantity that allows us to approximate the impact of the disease on the affected region. In recent years, final size measurements for vector-transmitted diseases have acquired importance because of the increased concern for mosquito-borne diseases like dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, etc. However, analytical expressions for this estimate in the stage-structured models applicable to vector-borne diseases are less, mostly focused on the classical Kermack\u2013McKendrick model. In this paper, we first calculate the final size expressions for an SIR model with carrier state and a SEIR\u2013SI host\u2013vector model. Then we extend this for the SEIR\u2013SI host\u2013vector model with treatment class in the host, as well as for the model with vertical transmission in the vector population. Finally, we verify our final size expression with some real scenarios.",

Their inducing epidemics last longer, have a higher number of asymptomatic cases, and are more serious. In this article, we proposed a nonautonomous time-delayed susceptible-infected-removed (NATD-SIR) model to predict them in different regions of China. We obtained the maximum and its time of current infected persons, the final size, and the end time of COVID-19 epidemics from January 2022 in China. The method of the fifth-order moving average was used to preprocess the time series of the numbers of current infected and removed cases to obtain more accurate parameter estimations. We found that usually the transmission rate $ \\beta(t) $ was a piecewise exponential decay function, but due to multiple bounces in Shanghai City, $ \\beta(t) $ was approximately a piecewise quadratic function. In most regions, the removed rate $ \\gamma(t) $ was approximately equal to a piecewise linear increasing function of (a*t+b)*H(t-k), but in a few areas, $ \\gamma(t) $ displayed an exponential increasing trend. For cases where the removed rate cannot be obtained, we proposed a method for setting the removed rate, which has a good approximation. Using the numerical solution, we obtained the prediction results of the epidemics. By analyzing those important indicators of COVID-19, we provided valuable suggestions for epidemic prevention and control and the resumption of work and production.",

                    "abstract": "Background Facing a global epidemic of new infectious diseases such as COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), which reduce transmission rates without medical actions, are being implemented around the world to mitigate spreads. One of the problems in assessing the effects of NPIs is that different NPIs have been implemented at different times based on the situation of each country; therefore, few assumptions can be shared about how the introduction of policies affects the patient population. Mathematical models can contribute to further understanding these phenomena by obtaining analytical solutions as well as numerical simulations. Methods and results In this study, an NPI was introduced into the SIR model for a conceptual study of infectious diseases under the condition that the transmission rate was reduced to a fixed value only once within a finite time duration, and its effect was analyzed numerically and theoretically. It was analytically shown that the maximum fraction of infected individuals and the final size could be larger if the intervention starts too early. The analytical results also suggested that more individuals may be infected at the peak of the second wave with a stronger intervention. Conclusions This study provides quantitative relationship between the strength of a one-shot intervention and the reduction in the number of patients with no approximation. This suggests the importance of the strength and time of NPIs, although detailed studies are necessary for the implementation of NPIs in complicated real-world environments as the model used in this study is based on various simplifications.",

                    "abstract": "Simple Summary Predicting the spreading trend of the COVID-19 epidemic is one of the hot topics in the modeling field. In this study, we applied a continuous Markov-chain model to simulate the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. The results of this study indicate that the herd immunity threshold should be significantly higher than 1 \u2212 1/R0. Taking the immunity waning effect into consideration, the model could predict an epidemic resurgence after the herd immunity threshold. Meanwhile, this Markov-chain approach could also forecast the epidemic distribution and predict the epidemic hotspots at different times. It is implied from our model that it is significantly challenging to eradicate SARS-CoV-2 in the short term. The actual epidemic development is consistent with our prediction. In the end, this method displayed great potential as an alternative approach to traditional compartment models. Abstract To address the urgent need to accurately predict the spreading trend of the COVID-19 epidemic, a continuous Markov-chain model was, for the first time, developed in this work to predict the spread of COVID-19 infection. A probability matrix of infection was first developed in this model based upon the contact frequency of individuals within the population, the individual\u2019s characteristics, and other factors that can effectively reflect the epidemic\u2019s temporal and spatial variation characteristics. The Markov-chain model was then extended to incorporate both the mutation effect of COVID-19 and the decaying effect of antibodies. The developed comprehensive Markov-chain model that integrates the aforementioned factors was finally tested by real data to predict the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic. The result shows that our model can effectively avoid the prediction dilemma that may exist with traditional ordinary differential equations model, such as the susceptible\u2013infectious\u2013recovered (SIR) model. Meanwhile, it can forecast the epidemic distribution and predict the epidemic hotspots geographically at different times. It is also demonstrated in our result that the influence of the population\u2019s spatial and geographic distribution in a herd infection event is needed in the model for a better prediction of the epidemic trend. At the same time, our result indicates that no simple derivative relationship exists between the threshold of herd immunity and the virus basic reproduction number R0. The threshold of herd immunity achieved through natural immunity is significantly higher than 1 \u2212 1/R0. These not only explain the theoretical misconceptions of herd immunity thresholds in herd immunity theory but also provide a guidance for predicting the optimal vaccination coverage. In addition, our model can predict the temporal and spatial distribution of infections in different epidemic waves. It is implied from our model that it is challenging to eradicate COVID-19 in the short term for a large population size and a wide spatial distribution. It is predicted that COVID-19 is likely to coexist with humans for a long time and that it will exhibit multipoint epidemic effects at a later stage. The statistical evidence is consistent with our prediction and strongly supports our modeling results.",

All possible pathways of the interaction between cationic species [Cp2ZrMe+] and counteranions, [A\u2212] = [MeB(C6F5)3]\u2212 and [B(C6F5)4]\u2212, were examined during chain initiation, propagation, and termination steps. The calculations reveal an active chain-end mechanism with O-alkyl bond cleavage of the polymerisation. The catalytic performance of the two counteranions is found to be identical, and they influence the initial process through stabilisation of the cationic species via non-covalent interactions (NCI), with the [MeB(C6F5)3]\u2212 anion stabilising the catalyst\u2013monomer complex more effectively than the [B(C6F5)4]\u2212 anion by 24.3 kJ mol\u22121. The first two propagations are likely the rate-determining step, with calculated free-energy barriers of 61.4\u201371.2 and 73.9\u201380.6 kJ mol\u22121 with and without the anions (A\u2212), respectively. The presence of the counteranion significantly affects the third propagation rate, lowering the barriers up to 20 kJ mol\u22121. Comparison of the first termination and the third propagation shows that they are not competitive, with the termination being less facile. We also studied the initiation and propagation steps for the hafnocene catalyst and found that the Hf catalyst slightly favours the CL CROP in comparison to the Zr catalyst. Analysis of solvent and dispersion interaction demonstrates that both factors play an important role in the process. NCI analysis reveals weak (van der Waals) interactions at the contacts between the cationic species and the counteranions during the reaction course.

The molecular structures of Fe2 and Fe3 were determined by X-ray diffraction, revealing a pseudo-square-pyramidal geometry. High activities were achieved toward ethylene polymerization in each iron complex case. The sterically least demanding ligand enhanced the activity of its complex Fe1 with the highest activity up to 16.8 \u00d7 106 g of PE (mol of Fe)-1 h-1at 70 \u00b0C, while the bulkiest ligand led to the formation of the highest molecular weight of the resulting polyethylene using Fe6. Generally, the resulting polyethylenes are highly linear and most of them have a tendency to display bimodal distributions by virtue of the presence of multiple sites or competing chain transfer reactions.

A\u03b240 and A\u03b242, as two most prominent isoforms of A\u03b2 peptides, can cross-interact with each other and form co-aggregates, which affect the progression of the disease. However, the molecular determinants underlying A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 cross-interaction and the structural details of their co-oligomers remain elusive. Herein, we performed all-atom explicit-solvent replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations on A\u03b240-A\u03b242 heterogeneous and A\u03b240/A\u03b242 homogeneous dimer systems to dissect the co-aggregation mechanisms of the two isoforms. Our results show that the interpeptide main-chain interaction of A\u03b240-A\u03b242 is stronger than that of A\u03b240-A\u03b240 and A\u03b242-A\u03b242. The positions of hotspot residues in heterodimers and homodimers display high similarity, implying similar molecular recognition sites for both cross-interaction and self-interaction. Contact maps of A\u03b240-A\u03b242 heterodimers reveal that residue pairs crucial for cross-interaction are mostly located in the C-terminal hydrophobic regions of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 peptides. Conformational analysis shows that A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 monomers can co-assemble into \u03b2-sheet-rich heterodimers with shorter \u03b2-sheets than those in homodimers, which is decremental to monomer addition. Similar molecular recognition sites and \u03b2-sheet distribution of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 peptides are observed in heterodimers and homodimers, which may provide the molecular basis for the two isoforms' co-aggregation and cross-seeding. Our work dissects the co-aggregation mechanisms of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 peptides at the atomic level, which will help for in-depth understanding of the cross-talk between the two A\u03b2 isoforms and the pathogenesis of AD.",

In this mini-review, the recent discovery of two unprecedented chain termination processes is summarized: chain transfer to solvent (CTS) and chain transfer to monomer (CTM), leading to benzyl/tolyl and allyl type chain ends, respectively. Although similar transfer reactions are well-known in radical polymerization, only very recently they have been observed also in olefin insertion polymerization catalysis. In the latter context, these processes were first identified in Ti-catalyzed propene and ethene polymerization; more recently, CTS was also reported in Sc-catalyzed styrene polymerization. In the Ti case, these processes represent a unique combination of insertion polymerization, organic radical chemistry and reactivity of a M(IV)/M(III) redox couple. In the Sc case, CTS occurs via a \u03c3-bond metathesis reactivity, and it is associated with a significant boost of catalytic activity and/or with tuning of polystyrene molecular weight and tacticity. The mechanistic studies that led to the understanding of these chain transfer reactions are summarized, highlighting their relevance in olefin polymerization catalysis and beyond.",

Indirect effects arise when vaccinated individuals block disease transmission in any infection chain they are part of, and this in turn can benefit both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Indirect effects are difficult to quantify in practice but, in this article, working with the susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered (SIR) model, they are analytically calculated in important cases, through pivoting on the final size formula for epidemics. Their relationship to herd immunity is also clarified. The analysis allows us to identify the important distinction between quantifying the indirect effects of vaccination at the \u2018population level\u2019 versus the \u2018per capita\u2019 level, which often results in radically different conclusions. As an example, our analysis unpacks why the population-level indirect effect can appear significantly larger than its per capita analogue. In addition, we consider a recently proposed epidemiological non-pharmaceutical intervention (by the means of recovered individuals) used over the COVID-19 pandemic, referred to as \u2018shielding\u2019, and study its impact on our mathematical analysis.

It is well known that treatment can have a specific effect on the spread of epidemics, and due to the limited resources of treatment, the number of patients during severe disease outbreaks who need to be treated may exceed the treatment capacity. Consequently, the number of patients who receive treatment will reach a saturation level. Thus, we incorporated a saturated treatment function into the model to characterize such a phenomenon. The dynamics of the present model is discussed in this paper. We first obtained a threshold value R0, which determines the stability of a disease-free equilibrium. Furthermore, we investigated the bifurcation behavior at R0=1. More specifically, we derived a condition that determines the direction of bifurcation at R0=1. If the direction is backward, then a stable disease-free equilibrium concurrently exists with a stable endemic equilibrium even though R0<1. Therefore, in this case, R0<1 is not sufficient to eradicate the disease from the population. However, if the direction is forward, we find that for a range of parameters, multiple equilibria could exist to the left and right of R0=1. In this case, the initial infectious invasion must be controlled to a lower level so that the disease dies out or approaches a lower endemic steady state.",

The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Hospitalized-Critical-Deaths (SEIR-HCD) model proposed in this research work is identified as a valuable tool for capturing the complex dynamics of disease transmission, healthcare demands, and mortality rates during epidemics.\n\nBackground: The spread of viral diseases is a major problem for public health services all over the world. Understanding how diseases spread is important in order to take the right steps to stop them. In epidemiology, the SIS, SIR, and SEIR models have been used to mimic and study how diseases spread in groups of people.\n\nMethodology: This research focuses on the integration of air traffic network data into the SEIR-HCD model to enhance the understanding of disease spread in air travel settings. By incorporating air traffic data, the model considers the role of travel patterns and connectivity in disease dissemination, enabling the identification of high-risk routes, airports, and regions.\n\nContribution: This research contributes to the field of epidemiology by enhancing our understanding of disease spread dynamics through the application of the SIS, SIR, and SEIR-HCD models. The findings provide insights into the factors influencing disease transmission, allowing for the development of effective strategies for disease control and prevention.\n\nFindings: The interplay between local outbreaks and global disease dissemination through air travel is empirically explored. The model can be further used for the evaluation of the effectiveness of surveillance and early detection measures at airports and transportation hubs. The proposed research contributes to proactive and evidence-based strategies for disease prevention and control, offering insights into the impact of air travel on disease transmission and supporting public health interventions in air traffic networks.\n\nRecommendations for Practitioners: Government intervention can be studied during difficult times which plays as a moderating variable that can enhance or hinder the efficacy of epidemic intelligence efforts within air traffic networks. Expert collaboration from various fields, including epidemiology, aviation, data science, and public health with an interdisciplinary approach can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the disease spread dynamics in air traffic networks. \n\nRecommendation for Researchers: Researchers can collaborate with international health organizations and authorities to share their research findings and contribute to a global understanding of disease spread in air traffic networks.\n\nImpact on Society: This research has significant implications for society. By providing a deeper understanding of disease spread dynamics, it enables policymakers, public health officials, and practitioners to make informed decisions to mitigate disease outbreaks. The recommendations derived from this research can aid in the development of effective strategies to control and prevent the spread of infectious diseases, ultimately leading to improved public health outcomes and reduced societal disruptions.\n\nFuture Research: Practitioners of the research can contribute more effectively to disease outbreaks within the context of air traffic networks, ultimately helping to protect public health and global travel. By considering air traffic patterns, the SEIR-HCD model contributes to more accurate modeling and prediction of disease outbreaks, aiding in the development of proactive and evidence-based strategies to manage and mitigate the impact of infectious diseases in the context of air travel.\n\n",

The IoT uses smart objects which are embedded into the environment and interact by transmitting several messages which interference with other messages on receiving nodes. This can lead to inevitable sensors\u2019 (nodes\u2019) deterioration after transmitting a considerable number of messages. Interference mitigation In a complex network such as the IoT is still a subject of active research which could benefit many real-world applications. Collection trees algorithms and protocols can be used adopted to reduce the interference on the nodes/paths of an IoT network but but can not fully stop or avoid interference across an IoT network. Building upon a mapping between path interference on devices (nodes) and real life contamination of a disease that can move an individual from a susceptible (S) to infected (I) and replaced (R) statuses, this paper revisits the collection tree algorithms with the objective of studying the dynamics of the interference in IoT networks. In this study, the IoT network\u2019s nodes are partitioned into mutually exclusive groups based on possible epidemic spread. For each group, an SIR model is proposed in a form of a system of difference equations. The model is analysed by studying the system stability and simulations are used to study the real time status of the interference across the network.",

We show that the diffusion is not described by the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, but rather by a new model, the Bass-SIR model, which combines the Bass model for diffusion of new products with the SIR model for epidemics. The phase transition of consumers from nonadopters to adopters is described by a nonstandard Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model, in which clusters growth is limited by adopters' recovery. Therefore, diffusion in the Bass-SIR model only depends on the local structure of the social network, but not on the average distance between consumers. Consequently, unlike the SIR model, a small-worlds structure has a negligible effect on the diffusion. Moreover, unlike the SIR model, there is no threshold value above which the diffusion will peter out. Surprisingly, diffusion on scale-free networks is nearly identical to that on Cartesian ones.",

In recent years, the research community has acquired strong evidences of complex and heterogeneous connections and diverse patterns in a variety of real human contact networks. The heterogeneity of network topologies has a deep influence on understanding the spreading dynamics of disease. In the process of infection spread, network edges are the critical communication channels. Many existing approaches for identifying prominent nodes in such networks rely on node attributes. Further, in unweighted networks, all the edges are considered to be equal, which imposes an unrealistic assumption for epidemic spreading through frequent interactions between humans. Here, we present an edge weighting technique, named as, Weighted Hybrid Centrality $\\left( {{W_{{C_H}}}} \\right)$, that takes into account multiple centrality indicators, including degree, k-shell, and eigenvector centrality, as well as the frequency of interactions be-tween any two users (nodes) which is considered as potential edge weight. To analyze the performance of ${W_{{C_H}}}$, we have utilized the weighted susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered (W-SIR) simulator and have carried out a comparative experiment on six real-world heterogeneous networks. The proposed technique outperforms the baseline methods with 0.067 to 0.641 averaged Kendall\u2019s \u03c4 score.

For the sake of dealing with this problem, there are three models being developed. Firstly, this paper establishes the model 1 on the basis of the classical model of SIR and diffusion characteristic of Ebola virus. It verifies the reduction of the spread of the virus, the improvement of the patient\u2019s cure rate and the effectiveness of three preventive measures which are significant in the formation of herd immunity. At the same time, we use linear programming to control the cost of drug delivery. Model 2, namely, the model of SIR with pulse vaccination, provides a pulse vaccination therapy on the basis of model 1. Model 2 considers many factors comprehensively, such as the cycle of inoculation, vaccination rate, the birth rate, death rate and so on. We use differential equation models to get the critical condition of the number of susceptible people, vaccination rate, and the development of predicated estimate with the change of time. Next, based on the model 2, we establish model 3 which not only considers many factors comprehensively, such as the amount of supply, the location of supply and so on, but also introduce 0-1 variable to combine the general linear programming with another linear programming which is not fixed but multi objectives so that we get the drug delivery network. Meanwhile, this paper obtains the best drug delivery program which has to spend the minimum cost on the condition of effectively controlling the epidemic. Also the result can alleviate serious situation of the Ebola virus epidemic diffusion through the drug delivery network. This paper puts forward the improvement of the model by using the Self-Organizing Map neural network and cluster analysis to get the urgent degree of different epidemic areas and divide these areas into different priorities. We get a goal programming model based on different priority. Furthermore, we use the drug delivery model and Lingo to get a more reliable drug delivery program on the basis of the objective function of priority.",

Based on the UAU-SIR model, we additionally consider three practical factors, including whether individuals will disseminate information or not, the influence of unaware individuals on aware individuals, and the direct recovery of asymptomatic infected individuals. Based on the microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA), for the proposed HTUA-SI^{a}I^{s}R model, MMCA equations\u00a0are generated and the analytical expression of the epidemic threshold is obtained. Compared with Monte Carlo techniques, numerical simulations show the feasibility and effectiveness of the MMCA equations, as well as the HTUA-SI^{a}I^{s}R model theoretically. Meanwhile, extensive simulations demonstrate that the acceleration of the awareness dissemination in the virtual communication layer can effectively block the epidemic spreading and raise the epidemic threshold. However, under certain conditions, the increasing of T-state individuals will increase the U-state individuals because the T-state and U-state individuals can influence the A-state individuals losing their awareness of protection, and then promote the epidemic spreading and decrease the epidemic threshold. In addition, reducing asymptomatic infections can hinder the epidemic spreading. But, when the recovery rate of asymptomatic infections is greater than that of symptomatic infections, decreasing the tendency of individuals acquiring asymptomatic infections will lower the epidemic threshold.",

Indirect effects arise when vaccinated individuals block disease transmission in any infection chain they are part of, and this in turn can benefit both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Indirect effects are difficult to quantify in practice but, in this article, working with the susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered (SIR) model, they are analytically calculated in important cases, through pivoting on the final size formula for epidemics. Their relationship to herd immunity is also clarified. The analysis allows us to identify the important distinction between quantifying the indirect effects of vaccination at the \u2018population level\u2019 versus the \u2018per capita\u2019 level, which often results in radically different conclusions. As an example, our analysis unpacks why the population-level indirect effect can appear significantly larger than its per capita analogue. In addition, we consider a recently proposed epidemiological non-pharmaceutical intervention (by the means of recovered individuals) used over the COVID-19 pandemic, referred to as \u2018shielding\u2019, and study its impact on our mathematical analysis. The shielding scheme is extended to take advantage of vaccination including imperfect vaccination.",

However, these models typically assume that populations are homogeneously mixed, ignoring possible variations in disease prevalence due to spatial heterogeneity. To address this issue, reaction-diffusion models have been proposed as an alternative approach to modeling spatially continuous populations in which individuals move in a diffusive manner. In this study, we explore the conditions under which such spatial structure must be explicitly considered to accurately predict disease spread, and when the assumption of homogeneous mixing remains adequate. In particular, we derive a critical threshold for the diffusion coefficient below which disease transmission dynamics exhibit spatial heterogeneity. We validate our analytical results with individual-based simulations of disease transmission across a two-dimensional continuous landscape. Using this framework, we further explore how key epidemiological parameters such as the probability of disease establishment, its maximum incidence, and its final epidemic size are affected by incorporating spatial structure into SI, SIS, and SIR models.

To approximate the expected dynamics of these processes, we employ a mean-field technique known as the N-Intertwined Mean-Field Approximation (NIMFA). Our primary goal is to quantify the impact of the randomness in the network topology on the accuracy of such approximations. While classical work by Kurtz established strong approximation results for density-dependent Markov chains using mean-field on the complete-graph of order $N$, yielding error bounds of order $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}$, we demonstrate that in the context of NIMFA on random graphs, the error admits a refined characterization depending on initial conditions. Specifically, for generic initial conditions, the worst case error is of order $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}$, where $d$ is the expected average degree of the graph. This result highlights how network sparsity contributes an additional source of variability not captured by classical mean-field approaches. Furthermore, when the initial conditions are taken to be fairly homogeneous, we show that the error term is of order $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}+\\frac{1}{d}$, where $N$ is the number of nodes, underscoring the intricate role of the choice of initial conditions in the error bounds.

Such epidemics are described by $2^n$- or $3^n$-state Markov chains. Ostensibly, because analyzing such Markov chains is too complicated, their $O(n)$-dimensional nonlinear \"mean-field\" approximation, and its linearization, are often studied instead. We provide a complete global analysis of the epidemic dynamics of the nonlinear mean-field approximation. In particular, we show that depending on the largest eigenvalue of the underlying graph adjacency matrix and the rates of infection, recovery, and vaccination, the global dynamics takes on one of two forms: either the epidemic dies out, or it converges to another unique fixed point (the so-called endemic state where a constant fraction of the nodes remain infected). A similar result has also been shown in the continuous-time case. We tie in these results with the \"true\" underlying Markov chain model by showing that the linear model is the tightest upper-bound on the true probabilities of infection that involves only marginals, and that, even though the nonlinear model is not an upper-bound on the true probabilities in general, it does provide an upper-bound on the probability of the chain not being absorbed. As a consequence, we also show that when the disease-free fixed point is globally stable for the mean-field model, the Markov chain has an $O(\\log n)$ mixing time, which means the epidemic dies out quickly.

In this model, vertices are either susceptible, infected, or recovered. Each infected vertex becomes recovered at rate 1 and infects each of its susceptible neighbors independently at rate $\\lambda$, and each recovered vertex becomes susceptible at a rate $\\varrho$, which we assume to be independent of the graph size. A central quantity of the SIRS process is the time until no vertex is infected, known as the survival time. Surprisingly though, rigorous theoretical results exist only for the related SIS model so far. We address this imbalance by conducting theoretical analyses of the SIRS process via their expansion properties. We prove that the expected survival time of the SIRS process on stars is at most polynomial in the graph size for any value of $\\lambda$. This behavior is fundamentally different from the SIS process, where the expected survival time is exponential already for small infection rates. Our main result is an exponential lower bound of the expected survival time of the SIRS process on expander graphs. Specifically, we show that on expander graphs $G$ with $n$ vertices, degree close to $d$, and sufficiently small spectral expansion, the SIRS process has expected survival time at least exponential in $n$ when $\\lambda \\geq c/d$ for a constant $c>1$. Previous results on the SIS process show that this bound is almost tight. Additionally, our result holds even if $G$ is a subgraph. Notably, our result implies an almost-tight threshold for Erdos-R\\'enyi graphs and a regime of exponential survival time for hyperbolic random graphs. The proof of our main result draws inspiration from Lyapunov functions used in mean-field theory to devise a two-dimensional potential function and applying a negative-drift theorem to show that the expected survival time is exponential.",

                    "abstract": "This study demonstrated the duration of immunity over 6 months of a vaccine against key bovine respiratory disease pathogens: Parainfluenza 3, Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Bovine Viral Diarrhoea and Mannheimia haemolytica. This was performed by challenge on colostrumdeprived calves at the age of 2 weeks. Recent European field isolates were used as challenge strains. Clinical signs and pathogen excretion or presence were monitored. Field relevance of the viral challenge strains was analysed using phylogenic analysis. Significant reduction of excretion of the 3 viruses in vaccinated animals was a consistent finding, demonstrating the efficacy of the vaccine. Reducing shedding is indeed key to interrupting the infection transmission chain and helping to achieve the protective effects of immunisation that extend beyond the individual. A significant reduction of clinical signs and lung lesions following the Mannheimia haemolytica challenge was also observed in vaccinated animals versus controls. Comparison of the challenge strains to an array of global and European strains, including recent ones, demonstrated a high genetic proximity, supporting the potential for the vaccine to maintain similar levels of efficacy in the field over a 6-month period post vaccination. Cattle, immunization, Parainfluenza 3, Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Bovine Viral Diarrhoea, Mannheimia haemolytica Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) is a multifactorial disease impacting cattle production. The disease is often referred to as a disease complex, involving both bacterial and viral pathogens as well as psychological (e.g. stress) and physical (e.g. air quality and temperature) factors in various combinations. It is recognized as having a major impact on the health and economics of beef and dairy production and is considered as the most important illness associated with feedlot cattle in the USA (Snowder et al. 2006) and possibly worldwide (Horwood et al. 2008). Bovine Respiratory Disease is a relatively common phenomenon in younger cattle, especially those housed in intensive conditions, with vaccination programmes against BRD commencing on some farms in calves as young as 2 weeks of age. The importance of the disease in young calves and growing animals requires the vaccines and programmes used from the outset to be as effective and appropriate as possible. The vaccine antigens being used need to be appropriate for the strains currently (and at risk of) circulating on farms. They also need to be presented efficiently to the vaccinated animal so as to ensure both an optimal primary vaccination course response and a long duration of protective immunity. The immuno-competence of vaccinated calves and the level of circulating maternally-derived colostral antibodies (MDA) present can also have an impact on the vaccination response. These factors and the specifics of the disease dynamics on farm are all important when determining the right vaccination approach.

As per regulatory requirements, colostrum deprived calves were used, hence the study did not consider the relevance of and approaches for MDAs. This study confirms the efficacy of the antigens (type and presentation), the likelihood of significant duration of immunity being achievable from the vaccine (6 months) and discusses the relevance of the antigens used to current circulating pathogens in Europe. Four different vaccination-challenge studies were carried out to investigate the duration of immunity provided by Bovalto Respi 4\u00ae against each of the strains included in the vaccine, i.e. Pi3, BRSV, BVD, and Mannheimia haemolytica. The design was similar for each study, apart from the challenge materials themselves and the type of follow-up that was used (adapted to each pathogen). Materials and Methods Vaccine efficacy Efficacy requirements of the immunogenicity test of the corresponding European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) monographs were applied when existing (or by default, monographs dealing with similar antigen were used). The consent of the Ethics Committee on the use of animals for the trial was obtained. Two-week-old colostrum deprived calves were vaccinated twice at 21-day intervals and challenged 6 months after the 2nd injection. Ten calves were used for the viral studies and divided into two groups, one of 5 vaccinated and one of 5 controls. Sixteen calves were used for Mannheimia haemolytica with groups of 8 each for the vaccinated animals and controls. Animals were observed daily during the 14 days after challenge for the viral strains in order to detect clinical symptoms of respiratory disease such as sneezing, nasal discharge, coughing, etc. A scoring table was used for each of the criteria. Rectal temperature was also recorded daily and temperatures above 40 \u00b0C were considered as hyperthermia. Nasal swabs were systematically performed, starting on the day of challenge and subsequently daily from the 3rd day post-challenge until the end of the study. The follow-up of calves challenged by Mannheimia haemolytica (M. haemolytica) was shorter, lasting just 7 days (as per Ph. Eur. 1944 recommendations for the immunogenicity test). Daily clinical observations for respiratory signs as well as rectal temperature were recorded. A post mortem examination was performed to identify lung lesions caused by M. haemolytica and to re-isolate the bacteria. Indeed, M. haemolytica is commensal in the upper respiratory tract, becoming pathogenic once it has reached the lungs where it causes severe pathology to lung tissue such as fibrinous changes and necrosis. Table 2 below recapitulates details on the challenge materials used in the vaccine efficacy studies (virus details and inoculation approach). Serology was performed on blood samples to determine the level of antibodies for the viral strains using virus neutralisation technique and results were expressed as PD50 (serum dilution protecting 50% of the infected wells). A classical enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to assess the level of M. haemolytica antibodies. Nasal swabs were immediately diluted and inoculated into MDBK cell line suspension on 96-well plates. After incubation for 5 days, Pi3 titre was determined based on its specific cytopathogenic effect whilst immunofluorescence staining was used to reveal and titrate the levels of BVD and BRSV. Results were expressed in TCID50 (50% Tissue Culture Infective Dose). In the course of M. haemolytica challenge, post mortem lungs samples were cultivated in a liquid medium in tubes. The positivity of the samples for M. haemolytica was then assessed. The level of difference between vaccinated and control groups was tested by comparison of two independent selections using the QC Expert 3.1 program and the significance level \u03b1 = 0.05. First, the compliance of variances of both selections was tested by the Fisher-Snedecor test and based on the test results a matching t-test (for the same or different variances) was subsequently used for testing of the compliance of the mean values.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPartner notification (PN) is the process whereby sexual partners of an index patient are informed of their exposure to a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and the need to obtain treatment. For the person (index patient) with a curable STI, PN aims to eradicate infection and prevent re-infection. For sexual partners, PN aims to identify and treat undiagnosed STIs. At the level of sexual networks and populations, the aim of PN is to interrupt chains of STI transmission. For people with viral STI, PN aims to identify undiagnosed infections, which can facilitate access for their sexual partners to treatment and help prevent transmission.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of different PN strategies in people with STI, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched electronic databases (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE) without language restrictions. We scanned reference lists of potential studies and previous reviews and contacted experts in the field. We searched three trial registries. We conducted the most recent search on 31 August 2012.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nPublished or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing two or more PN strategies. Four main PN strategies were included: patient referral, expedited partner therapy, provider referral and contract referral. Patient referral means that the patient notifies their sexual partners, either with (enhanced patient referral) or without (simple patient referral) additional verbal or written support. In expedited partner therapy, the patient delivers medication or a prescription for medication to their partner(s) without the need for a medical examination of the partner. In provider referral, health service personnel notify the partners. In contract referral, the index patient is encouraged to notify partner, with the understanding that the partners will be contacted if they do not visit the health service by a certain date.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe analysed data according to paired partner referral strategies. We organised the comparisons first according to four main PN strategies (1. enhanced patient referral, 2. expedited partner therapy, 3. contract referral, 4. provider referral). We compared each main strategy with simple patient referral and then with each other, if trials were available. For continuous outcome measures, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. We performed meta-analyses where appropriate. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome re-infection rate of the index patient by excluding studies with attrition of greater than 20%. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included 26 trials (17,578 participants, 9015 women and 8563 men). Five trials were conducted in developing countries. Only two trials were conducted among HIV-positive patients. There was potential for selection bias, owing to the methods of allocation used and of performance bias, owing to the lack of blinding in most included studies. Seven trials had attrition of greater than 20%, increasing the risk of bias.The review found moderate-quality evidence that expedited partner therapy is better than simple patient referral for preventing re-infection of index patients when combining trials of STIs that caused urethritis or cervicitis (6 trials; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.89, I(2) = 39%). When studies with attrition greater than 20% were excluded, the effect of expedited partner therapy was attenuated (2 trials; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.04, I(2) = 0%). In trials restricted to index patients with chlamydia, the effect was attenuated (2 trials; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.35, I(2) = 22%). Expedited partner therapy also increased the number of partners treated per index patient (three trials) when compared with simple patient referral in people with chlamydia or gonorrhoea (MD 0.43, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.58) or trichomonas (MD 0.51, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.67), and people with any STI syndrome (MD 0.5, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.67). Expedited partner therapy was not superior to enhanced patient referral in preventing re-infection (3 trials; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.53, I(2) = 33%, low-quality evidence). Home sampling kits for partners (four trials) did not result in lower rates of re-infection in the index case (measured in one trial), or higher numbers of partners elicited (three trials), notified (two trials) or treated (one trial) when compared with simple patient referral. There was no consistent evidence for the relative effects of provider, contract or other patient referral methods. In one trial among men with non-gonococcal urethritis, more partners were treated with provider referral than with simple patient referral (MD 0.5, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.63). In one study among people with syphilis, contract referral elicited treatment of more partners than provider referral (MD 2.2, 95% CI 1.95 to 2.45), but the number of partners receiving treatment was the same in both groups. Where measured, there was no statistical evidence of differences in the incidence of adverse effects between PN strategies.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence assessed in this review does not identify a single optimal strategy for PN for any particular STI. When combining trials of STI causing urethritis or cervicitis, expedited partner therapy was more successful than simple patient referral for preventing re-infection of the index patient but was not superior to enhanced patient referral. Expedited partner therapy interventions should include all components that were part of the trial intervention package. There was insufficient evidence to determine the most effective components of an enhanced patient referral strategy. There are too few trials to allow consistent conclusions about the relative effects of provider, contract or other patient referral methods for different STIs. More high-quality RCTs of PN strategies for HIV and syphilis, using biological outcomes, are needed.",

In this paper we study SIR models where heterogeneity is a result of the degree dependence of disease transmission rates. We develop numerical methods to determine the epidemic threshold, the epidemic probability and epidemic size close to the threshold for configuration model contact networks with arbitrary degree distribution and an arbitrary matrix of transmission rates (dependent on transmitting and receiving node degree). For the special case of separable transmission rates we obtain analytical expressions for these quantities. We propose a categorization of spreading processes based on the ratio of the probability of an epidemic and the expected size of an epidemic, and demonstrate that this ratio has a complex dependence on the degree distribution and the degree-dependent transmission rates. For scale-free contact networks and transmission rates that are power functions of transmitting and receiving node degrees, the epidemic threshold may be finite even when the degree distribution powerlaw exponent is below \u03b3 < 3. We give an expression, in terms of the degree distribution and transmission rate exponents, for the limit at which the epidemic threshold vanishes. We find that the expected epidemic size and the probability of an epidemic may grow nonlinearly above the epidemic threshold, with exponents that depend not only on the degree distribution powerlaw exponent, but on the parameters of the transmission rate degree dependence functions, in contrast to ordinary directed percolation and previously studied variations of the SIR model.",

This assumption provides analytical and computational advantages, however, it is often unrealistic when compared to empirical data. Current efforts in modeling nonexponentially distributed infectious periods are either limited to special cases or lead to unsolvable models. Also, the link between empirical data (the infectious period distribution) and the modeling needs (the definition of the corresponding recovery rates) lacks a clear understanding. Here we introduce a mapping of an arbitrary distribution of infectious periods into a distribution of recovery rates. Under the Markovian assumption to ensure analytical tractability, we show that the same infectious period distribution at the population level can be reproduced by two modeling schemes that we call and , depending on the individual response to the infection, and aggregated empirical data cannot easily discriminate the correct scheme. Besides being conceptually different, the two schemes also lead to different epidemic trajectories. Although sharing the same behavior close to the disease-free equilibrium, the scheme deviates from the expected epidemic when reaching the endemic equilibrium of a susceptible-infectious-susceptible transmission model, while the scheme turns out to be equivalent to assuming a homogeneous recovery rate. We show this through analytical computations and stochastic epidemic simulations on a contact network, using both generative network models and empirical contact data. It is therefore possible to reproduce heterogeneous infectious periods in network-based transmission models, however, the resulting prevalence is sensitive to the modeling choice for the interpretation of the empirically collected data on the length of the infectious period. In the absence of higher resolution data, studies should acknowledge such deviations in the epidemic predictions.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2024\n \n \n",

However, the resulting models are high-dimensional and their analysis is often out of reach. It turns out that mean-field models, low-dimensional systems of differential equations, whose variables are carefully chosen expected quantities from the exact model provide a good approximation and incorporate explicitly some network properties. Despite the emergence of such mean-field models, there has been limited work on investigating whether these can be used for inference purposes. In this paper, we consider network-based mean-field models and explore the problem of parameter identifiability when observations about an epidemic are available. Making use of the analytical tractability of most network-based mean-field models, e.g. explicit analytical expressions for leading eigenvalue and final epidemic size, we set up the parameter identifiability problem as finding the solution or solutions of a system of coupled equations. More precisely, subject to observing/measuring growth rate and final epidemic size, we seek to identify parameter values leading to these measurements. We are particularly concerned with disentangling transmission rate from the network density. To do this, we give a condition for practical identifiability and we find that except for the simplest model, parameters cannot be uniquely determined, that is, they are practically unidentifiable. This means that there exist multiple solutions (a manifold of infinite measure) which give rise to model output that is close to the data. Identifying, formalising and analytically describing this problem should lead to a better appreciation of the complexity involved in fitting models with many parameters to data.",

By performing phylogeographic analysis of MPXV genomes sampled from 757 individuals in NYC between April 2022 and April 2023, and 3,287 MPXV genomes sampled around the world, we identify over 200 introductions of MPXV into NYC with at least 84 leading to onward transmission. These infections primarily occurred among men who have sex with men, transgender women and nonbinary individuals. Through a comparative analysis with HIV in NYC, we find that both MPXV and HIV genomic cluster sizes are best fit by scale-free distributions, and that people in MPXV clusters are more likely to have previously received an HIV diagnosis and be a member of a recently growing HIV transmission cluster. We model MPXV transmission through sexual contact networks and show that highly connected individuals would be disproportionately infected at the start of an epidemic, which would likely result in the exhaustion of the most densely connected parts of the network, and, therefore, explain the rapid expansion and decline of the NYC outbreak. By coupling the genomic epidemiology of MPXV and HIV with epidemic modeling, we demonstrate that the transmission dynamics of MPXV in NYC can be understood by general principles of sexually transmitted pathogens.",

                    "abstract": "In this paper, a novel epidemic model of computer virus on scale-free network with nonlinear infectivity is proposed. The spreading dynamics of the virus was analyzed. The spreading critical threshold for the model was presented. Theoretical analyses indicate that the outbreak of the virus is entirely determined by the threshold. Numerical simulations confirmed the analytical results. Introduction Internet provides conveniently various services and information to people. Meanwhile, the easy access and wide usage of Internet make it a primary target for viruses. In the past, outbreaks of computer viruses have brought about huge financial losses. As the major means of defending against viruses, antivirus software is more a technique than a science; it cannot predict the evolution of viruses and hence, cannot provide global prevention/control policies. With the dramatic increase in the number of virus, relying solely on measures to clear the viruses can not meet the ultimate needs. Facing the severe situation of virus\u2019 destroy, it\u2019s urgent for people to establish epidemic model, explore virus propagation characteristics and advance controlling schemes in the network information security field. The computer viruses bear a striking resemblance to their biological counterparts. Cohen [1] and Murray [2] inventively suggested to exploit the tools developed in epidemic dynamics of infectious diseases to study the spreading behavior of computer viruses. Following this idea, Kephart and White [3] established the first epidemic model of computer viruses. From then on, most epidemic models usually have been proposed based on the assumption that Internet is homogeneous network [4-6]. At the end of last century empirical studies report that Internet has scale-free properties [7-9]. Studies on epidemic spreading in SF networks present us with surprising result, such as absence of any epidemic threshold, hierarchical spread of epidemic outbreaks [10-12], and so on. Most previous work toward this direction was limited to three simplistic models: the SI model [13-14], the SIS model [15-16] and the SIR model [17-18]. However, most previous works mainly focus on the impact of the underlying topology and assume that the transmission is uniformly distributed among all links, that is, each infected individual will try to contact all its susceptible neighbors once within one time step. In fact, this kind of uniform transmission is induced from the assumption that each node\u2019s potential infectivity, counted by its possible maximal contribution to the propagation process within one time step, is strictly equal to its degree, i.e., \u2018infectivity\u2261degree\u2019. The node with very large degree is called hub in computer networks, whereas the node with great infectivity in epidemic contact networks is termed super-spreader. Thus, the above assumption means hub\u2261super-spreader. This assumption fails to consider that the infectivity of an infected computer is limited, because computer\u2019s processing capacity and network bandwidth are limited. In this paper, we aim to overlook the above defects and understand the spreading behaviors of computer viruses in Internet. We present a novel SIDS (susceptible-infected-detached-susceptible) epidemic model of computer virus to investigate the impact of nonlinear infectivity in Internet with the scale-free property. We obtain the corresponding spreading threshold and analyze the globally dynamic behaviors of the virus. Then, the numerical simulations are given, which are well consistent with the theoretical results. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we will briefly formulate this novel epidemic model. Then in Section 3, we determine the threshold value and analyze the International Conference on Information Sciences, Machinery, Materials and Energy (ICISMME 2015) \u00a9 2015. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 1684 globally dynamic behaviors of the virus. In Section 4, we carry out extensive numerical simulations to verify the theoretical analysis in Section 3. At last, in Section 5 we summarize this work. Model formulation It is well known [11-13] that the node degrees of Internet asymptotically follow a power law distribution, ( ) P k k \u03b3 \u2212 \ufffd , where ( ) P k stands for the probability that a node chosen randomly from Internet is of degree k . For this model in Internet, each computer is represented by a vertex of the network and the edges are communication links between them, along which the infection may spread. Let ( ) k S t , ( ) k I t and ( ) k D t be the densities of susceptible, infected, and quarantined vertexes of degree k at time t . Obviously, they must satisfy the normalized condition ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 k k k S t I t D t + + = if the total number of the node is fixed. The infection transmission is defined by the spreading rate\u03bb , at which each susceptible computer acquires the infection from an infected neighbor during one time step. An infected computer goes through a quarantine period firstly before becoming susceptible again. The rate constant of quarantine for infected computers is denoted by \u03bc . \u03c4 is the average quarantine period. All parameters are positive. Then by applying the mean-field technique to the above assumptions, we have the following dynamics model based on delay differential equations ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) k k k",

                    "abstract": "Community structure is observed in many real-world networks, such as (online) social networks, where groups of friends of a certain person are often also friends of each other. Newman's modularity has been explored as an important quantitative metric for communities and clusters detection in networks. We present a new expressions and bounds for the modularity. These expressions reveal conditions for or properties of the maximum modularity of a network in both topological and spectral domains. Finding the maximum modularity of a given graph has been proven to be NP-complete and therefore, several heuristic algorithms have been proposed in the past. We investigate the problem of finding the maximum modularity of classes of graphs that have the same number of links and/or nodes and determine analytical upper bounds. Moreover, from the set of all connected graphs with a fixed number of links and/or number of nodes, we construct graphs that can attain maximum modularity, named maximum modular graphs. The maximum modularity is shown to depend on the residue obtained when the number of links is divided by the number of partitions. The modularity depends on the chosen partitioning of the network into communities, which makes finding the specific partition that leads to the maximum modularity a hard problem. In this thesis, we prove that deciding whether a graph with a given number of links, number of communities, and modularity exists is NP-complete and subsequently propose a heuristic algorithm for generating random graphs with a given modularity and number of links with different topological properties. The generator can be used in the broad field of modeling and analyzing clustered social or organizational networks. We also propose a model which can randomly generate simple graphs which are line graphs of other simple graphs, employing an iterative merging procedure. These graphs possess interesting properties, for example, if the cliques are all of the same size, the assortativities of the line graphs in each step are close to 0, and the assortativities of the corresponding root graphs increases linearly from -1 to 0 with the steps of the nodal merging process. Due to their importance to society, communication systems, represented as complex networks, should be built and operated to withstand failures. We define robustness as the maintenance of functionality under node or link removal. In this context, the functionality is measured by several graph metrics. We study the robustness of both static and time-varying networks under node removal, considering random node failure, as well as targeted node attacks based on network centrality measures. In static networks, targeted and random failures have been studied in the literature; however, existing approaches tend to study random failure in terms of average-case behavior, giving no idea of how badly network performance can degrade purely by chance. Instead of considering average network performance under random failure, we compute the network performance probability density functions as functions of the fraction of nodes removed. We show that many centrality measures produce similar targeted attacks in both static and time-varying networks and that a combination of degree centrality and eigenvector centrality may be enough to evaluate worst-case behavior of static networks: even small subsets of highly connected nodes act as a bottleneck in the static or temporal information flow, becoming critical weak points of the entire system. We also study the robustness envelope and targeted attack responses of static networks that are rewired to have high and low degree assortativities, discovering that moderate assortativity increases confer more robustness against targeted attacks whilst moderate decreases confer more robustness against random uniform attacks. In time-varying randomly generated networks, where all the nodes have similar properties, we show that random errors and intelligent attacks exhibit similar behavior. However, cost considerations make network providers less inclined to take robustness measures against failures that are unlikely to manifest, like several failures coinciding simultaneously. Considering networks embedded in a two-dimensional plane, we study the problem of finding a critical region - a part of the network that can be enclosed by a given elementary figure of predetermined size - whose destruction would lead to the highest network disruption. We determine that the problem is polynomially solvable and propose appropriate algorithms. In addition, we consider region-aware network augmentation to decrease the impact of a regional failure. We subsequently address the region-disjoint paths problem, which asks for two paths with minimum total weight between a source and a destination that cannot both be cut by a single regional failure of a given diameter (unless that failure includes the source and the destination). We prove that deciding whether region-disjoint paths exist is NP-hard and propose a heuristic region-disjoint paths algorithm. Defining an optimal protection strategy against viruses, spam propagation or any other kind of contamination process is an important feature for designing new networks and architectures. The first approach is a network adaptation, which is the interplay between disease dynamics on a network and the topology dynamics. A continuous-time adaptive Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (ASIS) model is introduced in order to investigate this interaction, where a susceptible node avoids infections by breaking its links to its infected neighbors while it enhances the connections with other susceptible nodes by creating links to them. When the initial topology of the network is a complete graph, an exact solution to the average metastable state fraction of infected nodes is derived without resorting to any mean-field approximation. A linear scaling law of the epidemic threshold as a function of the effective link-breaking rate is found. The metastable state topology shows high connectivity and low modularity in two cases: (i) a ``strongly adaptive'' region with very high effective spreading rate, and (ii) a ``weakly adaptive'' region with very low effective spreading rate. These two regions are separated from the other half-open elliptical-like regions of low connectivity and high modularity in a contour-line-like way. Our results indicate that the adaptation of the topology in response to disease dynamics suppresses the infection, while it promotes the network evolution towards a topology that exhibits assortative-mixing, modular structure and a binomial-like degree distribution. In the second approach, we consider decentralized optimal protection strategies when a virus is propagating over a network through a SIS epidemic process. By assuming that each node in the network can decide to protect itself from infection at a constant cost, we model our system using a game theoretic framework. We find pure, mixed equilibria, and the Price of Anarchy (PoA) in several network topologies and propose algorithms to compute a pure equilibrium.",

Then the nonvaccinated individuals will be infected with probability \u03b2. We apply the strategy to the susceptible-infected-recovered epidemic model in a multiplex network composed by two networks, where a fraction q of the nodes acts in both networks. We map this model of dynamic vaccination into bond percolation model and use the generating functions framework to predict theoretically the behavior of the relevant magnitudes of the system at the steady state. We find a perfect agreement between the solutions of the theoretical equations and the results of stochastic simulations. In addition, we find an interesting phase diagram in the plane \u03b2-\u03c9, which is composed of an epidemic and a nonepidemic phase, separated by a critical threshold line \u03b2c, which depends on q. As q decreases, \u03b2c increases, i.e., as the overlap decreases, the system is more disconnected, and therefore more virulent diseases are needed to spread epidemics. Surprisingly, we find that, for all values of q, a region in the diagram where the vaccination is so efficient that, regardless of the virulence of the disease, it never becomes an epidemic. We compare our strategy with random immunization and find that, using the same amount of vaccines for both scenarios, we obtain that the spread of disease is much lower in the case of dynamic vaccination when compared to random immunization. Furthermore, we also compare our strategy with targeted immunization and we find that, depending on \u03c9, dynamic vaccination will perform significantly better and in some cases will stop the disease before it becomes an epidemic.",

We relax the assumption that vaccination prevents all transmission of a disease used in previous studies, such that vaccinated nodes have a small probability of transmission. To do so, we extend the cavity method to study networks where nodes have heterogeneous transmissibility. We find that vaccination with partial transmission still provides herd immunity and show how the herd immunity threshold depends upon the assortativity between nodes of different transmissibility. In addition, we study the impact of social distancing via bond percolation and show that percolation targeting links between nodes of high transmissibility can reduce the risk of an epidemic greater than targeting links between nodes of high degree. Finally, we extend recent methods to compute the distributional equations of risk in populations with heterogeneous transmissibility and show how targeted social distancing measures may reduce overall risk greater than untargeted vaccination campaigns, by comparing the effect of random and targeted strategies of node and link deletion on the risk distribution.",

This may be due to the use of imperfect vaccines and there has been much discussion on the different modes by which vaccines might fail. To understand the epidemiological implications of some of these different modes, we performed a systematic analysis of a model based on the standard SIR equations with a vaccinated component that permits vaccine failure in degree (\"leakiness\"), take (\"all-or-nothingness\") and duration (waning of vaccine-derived immunity). The model was first considered as a system of ordinary differential equations, then extended to a system of partial differential equations to accommodate age structure. We derived analytic expressions for the steady states of the system and the final age distributions in the case of homogenous contact rates. The stability of these equilibria are determined by a threshold parameter Rp , a function of the vaccine failure parameters and the coverage p. The value of p for which Rp = 1 yields the critical vaccination ratio, a measure of herd immunity. Using this concept we can compare vaccines that confer the same level of herd immunity to the population but may fail at the individual level in different ways. For any fixed Rp > 1, the leaky model results in the highest prevalence of infection, while the all-or-nothing and waning models have the same steady state prevalence. The actual composition of a vaccine cannot be determined on the basis of steady state levels alone, however the distinctions can be made by looking at transient dynamics (such as after the onset of vaccination), the mean age of infection, the age distributions at steady state of the infected class, and the effect of age-specific contact rates.",

The investigation is carried out mainly through simulations with ad-hoc developed algorithms coupled with analytical studies of both the global system connectivity and the details of a realistic electron tunneling inter-particle conduction mechanism. Conductive polymer nanocomposites manifest a sudden increase of the bulk conductivity when the content of the conductive species exceeds a certain threshold, a behavior shared with many other insulator-conductor biphasic systems. Percolation theory remains the most widely used theoretical formulation to describe for such transition. Its embodiment which most faithfully takes into account the microscopic features of the composite is the hard-core-penetrable-shell model, and in the present work has been extended to a wide range of anisotropic filler particle shapes modeled as hard ellipsoids-of-revolution. However, such connectivity-based description of the insulator transition manifests some fundamental incompatibilities when applied to the specific case of nanocomposites. Indeed, the percolation formulation requires the connections between the filler particles to be of the \"on-off\" binary sort, but this is in contrast with a microscopically justified electron tunneling inter-particle conduction mechanism, which entails no sharp cutoff of the connectivity. Since the tunneling conductance decays exponentially over the distance with a characteristic decay length in the order of a few nanometers, for macroscopic fillers an abrupt cutoff description of inter-particle connectivity may still be suitable. This ceases to be valid for nanometric fillers, which have one or more characteristic dimensions that are comparable with the distances of tunneling. The solution of the tunneling-percolation problem in the nanocomposite regime is the main focus of this thesis. We present a model of conductivity where the filler particles form a network of globally connected objects via tunneling. Such a model does not need any abrupt interruption to induce the insulator-conductor transition and is able to reproduce the typical conductivity versus nanofiller volume fraction curves found experimentally. In this description, the transition is interpreted as the crossover region where the conductivity contribution due to the tunneling network overtakes the intrinsic one of the polymer matrix. Furthermore, we introduce an approximation route and explicit formulas based on the critical path method, which allow a quick and precise estimation of the overall system conductivity for various commonly employed nanocomposites. The validity of our formulation is verified by extracting from a large number of experimental results the characteristic tunneling length, which is found to be within the expected range of its values. Finally, we consider the case of graphite polymer composites in more detail, and we introduce a simple model of conductivity, which is able to account for some of the features of these materials.",

Public awareness plays a crucial role, as individual vaccination decisions significantly impact collective efforts to combat emerging health threats. This study explores disease transmission within a framework integrating social connections, information sharing, and individual vaccination decisions. We introduce a behaviour-prevalence model on an adaptive multiplex network, where the physical layer (Layer-II) captures disease transmission under vaccination. In contrast, the virtual layer (Layer-I) represents adaptive social contacts and the flow of information, shaping vaccination decisions within a socially influenced environment. We derive analytical expressions for the epidemic threshold using the microscopic Markov Chain Method (MMCM). Simulation results highlight that adaptive social contacts lead to a higher epidemic threshold than non-adaptive networks. Additionally, network characteristics, such as the power-law exponent in scale-free networks, significantly impact infection spread within populations. Our results reveal that changes in perceived infection risk and an individual\u2019s sensitivity to non-vaccinated neighbour\u2019s status strongly influence vaccine uptake across populations.

As a result, age-stratified modeling for COVID-19 dynamics is the key to study how to reduce hospitalizations and mortality from COVID-19. By taking advantage of network theory, we develop an age-stratified epidemic model for COVID-19 in complex contact networks. Specifically, we present an extension of standard SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) compartmental model, called age-stratified SEAHIR (susceptible-exposed-asymptomatic-hospitalized-infectious-removed) model, to capture the spread of COVID-19 over multitype random networks with general degree distributions. We derive several key epidemiological metrics and then propose an age-stratified vaccination strategy to decrease the mortality and hospitalizations. Through extensive study, we discover that the outcome of vaccination prioritization depends on the reproduction number <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$R_0$</tex-math></inline-formula>. Specifically, the elderly should be prioritized only when <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$R_0$</tex-math></inline-formula> is relatively high.

These networks reveal how social distancing measures and the public\u2019s reaction to the incipient pandemic affected the connectivity patterns within the city. We find that as the pandemic developed there was a substantial decrease in the number of individuals with many contacts. We further study the impact of these different network topologies on the spread of COVID-19 by simulating an SEIR epidemic model over these networks and find that the reduced connectivity greatly suppressed the epidemic. We then investigate how the epidemic responds when part of the population is vaccinated, and we compare two vaccination distribution strategies, both with and without social distancing. Our main result is that the heavy-tailed degree distribution of the contact networks causes a targeted vaccination strategy that prioritizes high-contact individuals to reduce the number of cases far more effectively than a strategy that vaccinates individuals at random. Combining both targeted vaccination and social distancing leads to the greatest reduction in cases, and we also find that the marginal benefit of a targeted strategy as compared to a random strategy exceeds the marginal benefit of social distancing for reducing the number of cases. These results have important implications for ongoing vaccine distribution efforts worldwide.",

However, resource constraints often require decisions based on partial network data. We investigated how the effectiveness of network-based vaccination schemes varied based on the accuracy of network data available. Methods: We simulated propagating an SIR process on static empirical social networks from 75 rural Indian villages. First, we used regression analysis to predict the percentage of individuals ever infected (cumulative incidence) based on village-level networks. Second, we simulated vaccinating 10% of each village at baseline, selecting vaccinees using 1 of 5 network-based approaches: at random (Random); random contacts of random individuals (Nomination); random high-degree individuals (High Degree); highest degree (Highest Degree); or most central (Central). The first three approaches require only sample data; the latter two require full network data. We also simulated imposing a limit on how many contacts an individual can nominate (Fixed Choice Design, FCD), which reduces data collection burden but generates only partially observed networks. Results: We found the mean and standard deviation of the degree distribution to strongly predict cumulative incidence. In simulations, Nomination reduced cumulative incidence by one-sixth compared to Random vaccination; full network methods reduced infection by two-thirds. High Degree had intermediate effectiveness. Somewhat surprisingly, FCD truncating individuals' degrees at three was as effective as using complete networks. Conclusions: Using even partial network information to prioritize vaccines at either the village or individual level substantially improved epidemic outcomes. Such approaches may be feasible and effective in outbreak settings, and full ascertainment of network structure may not be required.",

By analyzing the conditions for the existence of endemic equilibrium points, we derive the basic reproduction numbers and outbreak thresholds for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. The epidemic model is then reconstructed and extensively analyzed using continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) methods. This analysis includes the investigation of transition probabilities, transition rate matrices, steady-state distributions, and the transition probability matrix based on the embedded chain. In numerical simulations, a notable concordance exists between the outcomes of CTMC and mean-field (MF) simulations, thereby substantiating the efficacy of the CTMC model. Moreover, the CTMC-based model adeptly captures the inherent stochastic fluctuation in the disease transmission, which is consistent with the mathematical properties of Markov chains. We further analyze the relationship between the system\u2019s steady-state infection density and the immunization rate through MCS. The results suggest that the infection density decreases with an increase in the immunization rate among susceptible individuals. The current research results will enhance our understanding of infectious disease transmission patterns in real-world scenarios, providing valuable theoretical insights for the development of epidemic prevention and control strategies.",

Under various vaccine action models, we consider both household-based vaccination schemes, in which the way in which individuals are chosen for vaccination depends on the size of the households in which they reside, and acquaintance vaccination, which targets individuals of high degree in the social network. For both types of vaccination scheme, assuming a large population with few initial infectives, we derive a threshold parameter which determines whether or not a large outbreak can occur and also the probability of a large outbreak and the fraction of the population infected by a large outbreak. The performance of these schemes is studied numerically, focusing on the influence of the household size distribution and the degree distribution of the social network. We find that acquaintance vaccination can significantly outperform the best household-based scheme if the degree distribution of the social network is heavy-tailed. For household-based schemes, when the vaccine coverage is insufficient to prevent a major outbreak and the vaccine is imperfect, we find situations in which both the probability and size of a major outbreak under the scheme which minimises the threshold parameter are larger than in the scheme which maximises the threshold parameter.",

In the absence of pharmaceutical interventions (i.e. vaccines), the only way to control a given disease is to move this threshold by non-pharmaceutical interventions like social distancing, past the epidemic threshold corresponding to the disease, thereby tipping the system from epidemic into a non-epidemic regime. Modeling the disease as a spreading process on a social graph, social distancing can be modeled by removing some of the graphs links. It has been conjectured that the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the resulting graph corresponds to the systems epidemic threshold. Here we use a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to study those link removals that do well at reducing the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix. The MCMC method generates samples from the relative canonical network ensemble with a defined expectation value of \u03bbmax\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$\\lambda _{\\text {max}}$$\\end{document}. We call this the \u201cwell-controlling network ensemble\u201d (WCNE) and compare its structure to randomly thinned networks with the same link density. We observe that networks in the WCNE tend to be more homogeneous in the degree distribution and use this insight to define two ad-hoc removal strategies, which also substantially reduce the largest eigenvalue. A targeted removal of 80% of links can be as effective as a random removal of 90%, leaving individuals with twice as many contacts. Finally, by simulating epidemic spreading via either an SIS or an SIR model on network ensembles created with different link removal strategies (random, WCNE, or degree-homogenizing), we show that tipping from an epidemic to a non-epidemic state happens at a larger critical ratio between infection rate and recovery rate for WCNE and degree-homogenized networks than for those obtained by random removals.",

In the present study, we deal with a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) metapopulation model where the epidemic process in each patch is represented by an SIR model and the mobility of individuals is assumed to be a homogeneous diffusion. We consider two types of patches including high-risk and low-risk ones under the assumption that a local patch is changed from a high-risk one to a low-risk one by an intervention. We theoretically analyze the intervention threshold which indicates the critical fraction of low-risk patches for preventing a global epidemic outbreak. We show that an intervention targeted to high-degree patches is more effective for epidemic control than a random intervention. The theoretical results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations for synthetic and realistic scale-free patch networks. The theoretical results also reveal that the intervention threshold depends on the human mobility network and the mobility rate.

In one regime, the mixed strategy performs poorly compared with targeted vaccination alone, while in the other regime, the addition of ring vaccination can improve the performance of targeted vaccination.

Influenza disease causes substantial morbidity and mortality in children, adolescents, and adults; vaccination is the best method to prevent this disease. In light of the increasing understanding of the burden of influenza among children and adolescents and its spread from children to adults, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices expanded its influenza vaccination recommendations in 2008 to include all children and adolescents between 6 months and 18 years of age. More than 65 million children and adolescents should be vaccinated annually, usually within a short timeframe of several months when the vaccine is available. While influenza vaccination coverage nationwide has increased, it remains low\u2014only about half of all children and adolescents are vaccinated. In the United States, primary care practices bear the major burden of vaccinating children and adolescents, and because most do not have health care visits during the influenza vaccination season, experts have recommended patient reminder/ recall to remind families to bring their child or adolescent in for vaccination. Patient reminder/recall has traditionally consisted of mailed letters or postcards or telephone calls made by office staff or by autodialer machines that can call hundreds of families per hour. Yet practice-based reminder/ recall is easier to suggest than implement. Many primary care practices do not use reminder/recall because of the logistical challenges in setting up and maintaining these systems. Furthermore, although initial studies suggested a positive effect of reminder/recall on influenza vaccination rates, recent studies of patient reminder/recall targeting low-income populations have found minimal or no effect, in large part because of changing or inaccurate patient telephone numbers and addresses. Thus new strategies are needed for patient reminder/ recall, particularly for low-income populations. In this issue of JAMA, Stockwell and colleagues leverage a rapidly expanding application\u2014text messaging, within a ubiquitous technology\u2014the cellular telephone. They present findings from a randomized controlled trial of text message reminders to low-income families about influenza vaccination. The study was a pragmatic trial located in 4 primary care clinics in New York, New York. These practices are part of a network with a common electronic health record (EHR) that has an institutional immunization information system that links with the EHR and the New York Citywide Immunization Registry, and that was customized to send text messages. The investigators randomized 9213 children and adolescents to receive either a set of text message reminders about influenza vaccination (intervention group) or a single telephone reminder call (usual care group). The first 3 text messages informed parents about influenza and vaccine safety and effectiveness; subsequent text messages provided specific information about Saturday vaccination clinics. The clinical trial noted a modest increase in vaccination rates. Among the 7574 children and adolescents, 43.6% of the intervention group and 39.9% of the usual care group were vaccinated. Ultimately, vaccination rates remained low, but the cost of the intervention also was minimal. The strengths of this clinical trial include its study design, incorporation of a new patient-physician communication technology (text messaging), a focus on a vulnerable urban population, and its application to time-critical vaccination because the vaccine must be administered prior to influenza season. The text message intervention served to both educate and remind parents and was rather aggressive with an average of 5 reminders sent to families. Furthermore, the study was conducted in a setting with integrated information systems that are not yet replicable in many primary care practices. Nevertheless, several methodological features probably diminished the potential effect of the intervention. The control group received 1 automated telephone reminder. While the reminders mentioned Saturday vaccination clinics, they did not mention regular weekday hours, which is when most children and adolescents received their immunizations. Thus, refinements might increase the effect of the intervention. This study highlights the potential for patient reminder/ recall but also its challenges. The potential is substantial, and in the right setting with automated, integrated information systems, text message reminders can target large numbers of patients at relatively low cost. They can be sent from centralized clinical information systems (as in this study), or from state-based immunization registries so that individual practices may not need to create their own patient reminder systems. In fact, immunization experts are currently debating the relative merit of individual practice-based vs system-based pa-",

The fundamental mechanisms of disease progression and epidemic spread provide important constraints on interpreting changing epidemic cases counts with time and geography in the context of on-going interventions, mitigations, and controls. Models such as these that account for the effects of human actions can also allow evaluation of the importance of categories of epidemic and disease controls. Introduction We present the EpiEarly, EpiGrid, and EpiCast tools for mechanistically-based biological decision support. The range of tools covers coarse-, medium-, and fine-grained models. The coarse-grained, aggregated time-series only data tool (EpiEarly) provides a statistic quantifying epidemic growth potential and associated uncertainties. The medium grained, geographically-resolved model (EpiGrid) is based on differential equation type simulations of disease and epidemic progression in the presence of various human interventions geared toward understanding the role of infection control, early vs. late diagnosis, vaccination, etc. in outbreak control. A fine-grained hybrid-agent epidemic model (EpiCast) with diurnal agent travel and contagion allows the analysis of the importance of contact-networks, travel, and detailed intervention strategies for the control of outbreaks and epidemics. Methods We use three types of methods for simulation and analysis. They are: (1) Bayesian and regression methods allowing estimation of the basic reproductive number from case-count data; (2) ordinary-differential equation integration with modifications to account for discreteness of disease spread when case counts are small (we include space- and time-dependent effects); and (3) methods that hybridize agent-based travel, mixing, and disease progression with nested-mass action contagion (i.e. not fully agent-based). From the perspective of decision support, the crucial feature of mechanistic infectious epidemiological models is a way to capture the human interventions that determine epidemic outcome. Categorizing types of mitigation into those that change the force of infection , and those that branch disease progression allows a common framework that can be extended from medium-grained models through fine-grained. Our canonical example is our EpiGrid tool which allows for the modulation of the force of infection (i.e. contagion) with time (and potentially space), the vaccination of a susceptible population in a geographically-targeted manner, movement controls, and branching our disease progression model to account for early- vs. late-intervention during host disease progression. Results We will present analysis of diseases that exemplify the various aspects of analysis in support of outbreak and epidemic control. Human and animal diseases relevant to this demonstration include rinderpest, avian influenza, and measles. We will begin with EpiEarly\u2019s estimate of epidemic potential using aggregated time-dependent case-count data. The key observation for EpiEarly is that under a wide range of situations a disease's reproductive number should be generalized to a distribution of possibilities to account for inherent randomness and other factors (including the variability of a disease contact network). We will then continue with a demonstration of EpiGrid\u2019s capabilities for understanding and modelling the role of interventions including contagion control (the force of infection), treatment (changing disease progression and infectiousness depending on treatment), vaccination, culling, and movement controls. We will briefly touch on the capabilities of EpiCast for more detailed analysis of specific intervention strategies. Conclusions We will demonstrate examples where modeling either contributed or plausibly would contribute to informing epidemic and outbreak control constrained by the possibilities of the underlying epidemic and disease dynamics.",

By analyzing the conditions for the existence of endemic equilibrium points, we derive the basic reproduction numbers and outbreak thresholds for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. The epidemic model is then reconstructed and extensively analyzed using continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) methods. This analysis includes the investigation of transition probabilities, transition rate matrices, steady-state distributions, and the transition probability matrix based on the embedded chain. In numerical simulations, a notable concordance exists between the outcomes of CTMC and mean-field (MF) simulations, thereby substantiating the efficacy of the CTMC model. Moreover, the CTMC-based model adeptly captures the inherent stochastic fluctuation in the disease transmission, which is consistent with the mathematical properties of Markov chains. We further analyze the relationship between the system\u2019s steady-state infection density and the immunization rate through MCS. The results suggest that the infection density decreases with an increase in the immunization rate among susceptible individuals. The current research results will enhance our understanding of infectious disease transmission patterns in real-world scenarios, providing valuable theoretical insights for the development of epidemic prevention and control strategies.",

However, in real-world scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or remove) in order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of current COVID-19 epidemic. Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only n nodes are observed at a time and the most central between these n nodes is immunized (or attacked). This process is continued repeatedly until 1-p fraction of nodes are immunized (or attacked). We develop an analytical framework for this approach and determine the critical percolation threshold pc and the size of the giant component P\u221e for networks with arbitrary degree distributions P(k). In the limit of n\u2192\u221e we recover prior work on targeted attack, whereas for n=1 we recover the known case of random failure. Between these two extremes, we observe that as n increases, pc increases quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization (attack) with complete information. In particular, we find a new scaling relationship between |pc(\u221e) -pc (n)| and n as |pc(\u221e) -pc (n)|~n-1exp(-\u03b1 n). For Scale-free (SF) networks, where P(k)~k-\u03b3,2<\u03b3<3), we find that pc has a transition from zero to non-zero when n increases from n=1 to order of logN (N is the size of network). Thus, for SF networks, knowledge of order of logN nodes and immunizing them can reduce dramatically an epidemics.",

Traditional network-based epidemic models operate under the assumption of a stable population size, often overlooking the impactful role of population mobility. Therefore, in this work, we present an enhanced SIR model, which incorporates population mobility and bidirectional immunization into the standard SIR model. Through theoretical analysis, we calculate the fundamental reproduction numbers and outbreak thresholds for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. The influence of two-way immunization and population mobility on the diffusion of infectious diseases is then examined via numerical simulations in both ER and BA networks. The simulation outcomes highlight the effectiveness of the outflow of infected and recovered individuals in curbing the extent of epidemics. Additionally, immunization measures targeting infected individuals not only shrink the transmission range of infectious diseases but also act to postpone the spread of epidemics. Notably, compared with homogeneous networks, infectious diseases have stronger transmission ability in heterogeneous networks, indicating heterogeneity of networks facilitates epidemic spreading.",

A lot of research has been done on targeted immunization strategies, exploiting various global network topological properties.

Therefore, immunization strategies that can deal with a limited knowledge of the network structure are required. In this paper, we propose targeted immunization strategies that require information only at the community level. Results of our investigations on the SIR epidemiological model, using a realistic synthetic benchmark with controlled community structure, show that the community structure plays an important role in the epidemic dynamics. An extensive comparative evaluation demonstrates that the proposed strategies are as efficient as the most influential global centrality based immunization strategies, despite the fact that they use a limited amount of information. Furthermore, they outperform alternative local strategies, which are agnostic about the network structure, and make decisions based on random walks.",

Under various vaccine action models, we consider both household-based vaccination schemes, in which the way in which individuals are chosen for vaccination depends on the size of the households in which they reside, and acquaintance vaccination, which targets individuals of high degree in the social network. For both types of vaccination scheme, assuming a large population with few initial infectives, we derive a threshold parameter which determines whether or not a large outbreak can occur and also the probability of a large outbreak and the fraction of the population infected by a large outbreak. The performance of these schemes is studied numerically, focusing on the influence of the household size distribution and the degree distribution of the social network.

Meanwhile, individuals tend to protect themselves by avoiding contacts with infections at a microscopic level. However, a comprehensive understanding of how such combined strategy influences epidemic dynamics is still lacking. We study a susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model with imperfect vaccination on dynamic contact networks, where the macroscopic intervention is represented by random vaccination of the population and the microscopic protection is characterised by susceptible individuals rewiring contacts from infective neighbours. In particular, the model is formulated both in populations without and then with demographic effects (births, deaths, and migration). Using the pairwise approximation and the probability generating function approach, we investigate both dynamics of the epidemic and the underlying network. For populations without demography, the emerging degree correlations, bistable states, and oscillations demonstrate the combined effects of the public vaccination program and individual protective behavior. Compared to either strategy in isolation, the combination of public vaccination and individual protection is more effective in preventing and controlling the spread of infectious diseases by increasing both the invasion threshold and the persistence threshold. For populations with additional demographic factors, we investigate temporal evolution of infected individuals and infectious contacts, as well as degree distributions of nodes in each class. It is found that the disease spreads faster but is more restricted in scale-free networks than in the Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi ones. The integration between vaccination intervention and individual rewiring may promote epidemic spreading due to the birth effect. Moreover, the degree distributions of both networks in the steady state is closely related to the degree distribution of newborns, which leads to uncorrelated connectivity. All the results demonstrate the importance of both local protection and global intervention, as well as the demographic effects. Our work thus offers a more comprehensive description of disease containment.",

However, the RR method needs to carefully consider all nodes within a network, leading to high computational time. To close this gap, we propose the fringe node set: it is applied to an immunization strategy such as RR to remove noncritical nodes before optimizing the node sequence. Besides adapting this algorithm for strategies, such as RR and degree centrality strategy, we further propose a novel reconstruction method (RM) under the percolation perspective, which ranks critical nodes by measuring their contribution to the giant component in the network reconstruction or node reoccupying process. Experimental results based on our proposed identification method have demonstrated the feasibility of using the fringe node set.

The main task of the DSI problem is to optimize an estimator, such that the real source can be more precisely targeted. In this article, we assume that the state of a number of nodes, called observer set, in a network could be investigated if necessary, and study what configuration of those nodes could facilitate a better solution for the DSI problem. In particular, we find that the conventional error distance metric cannot precisely evaluate the effectiveness of varied DSI approaches in heterogeneous networks, and thus propose a novel and more general measurement, the candidate set, that is formulated to contain the diffusion source for sure. We propose the percolation-based evolutionary framework (PrEF) to optimize the observer set such that the candidate set can be minimized. Hence, one could further conduct more intensive investigation or search on only a few nodes to target the source. To achieve that, we first theoretically show that the size of the candidate set is bounded by the size of the largest component cover, and demonstrate that there are some similarities between the DSI problem and the network immunization problem. We find that, given the associated direction information of the diffusion is known on observers, the minimization of the candidate set is equivalent to the minimization of the order parameter if we view the observer set as the removal node set. Hence, PrEF is developed based on the network percolation and evolutionary algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on both synthetic and empirical networks in regard to varied circumstances. Our results show that the developed approach could achieve much smaller candidate sets compared to the state of the art in almost all cases, e.g., it is better in 26 out of 27 empirical networks and 155 out of 162 cases regarding the critical threshold. Meanwhile, our approach is also more stable, i.e., it works well irrespective of varied infection probabilities, diffusion models, and underlying networks. More importantly, we provide a framework for the analysis of the DSI problem in large-scale networks.",

However, in real-world scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or remove) in order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of current COVID-19 epidemic. Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only n nodes are observed at a time and the most central between these n nodes is immunized (or attacked). This process is continued repeatedly until 1-p fraction of nodes are immunized (or attacked). We develop an analytical framework for this approach and determine the critical percolation threshold pc and the size of the giant component P\u221e for networks with arbitrary degree distributions P(k). In the limit of n\u2192\u221e we recover prior work on targeted attack, whereas for n=1 we recover the known case of random failure. Between these two extremes, we observe that as n increases, pc increases quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization (attack) with complete information. In particular, we find a new scaling relationship between |pc(\u221e) -pc (n)| and n as |pc(\u221e) -pc (n)|~n-1exp(-\u03b1 n). For Scale-free (SF) networks, where P(k)~k-\u03b3,2<\u03b3<3), we find that pc has a transition from zero to non-zero when n increases from n=1 to order of logN (N is the size of network).

By analyzing the conditions for the existence of endemic equilibrium points, we derive the basic reproduction numbers and outbreak thresholds for both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. The epidemic model is then reconstructed and extensively analyzed using continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) methods. This analysis includes the investigation of transition probabilities, transition rate matrices, steady-state distributions, and the transition probability matrix based on the embedded chain. In numerical simulations, a notable concordance exists between the outcomes of CTMC and mean-field (MF) simulations, thereby substantiating the efficacy of the CTMC model. Moreover, the CTMC-based model adeptly captures the inherent stochastic fluctuation in the disease transmission, which is consistent with the mathematical properties of Markov chains. We further analyze the relationship between the system\u2019s steady-state infection density and the immunization rate through MCS. The results suggest that the infection density decreases with an increase in the immunization rate among susceptible individuals.

Firstly, the method collects the start time of the transmitted signal of the underwater acoustic sensor network and the time of the signal's arrival at the sensing node. Accordingly, the time of the signal reception of each node could be calculated. Secondly, considering the time continuity between the received and the returned signal in the random direct access protocol, the connectivity between nodes is judged according to it. Finally, collecting all the nodes that may have continuity in signal reception time and transmission time within the perception time interval, the network topology is obtained by setting the threshold and excluding the false links.

Under various vaccine action models, we consider both household-based vaccination schemes, in which the way in which individuals are chosen for vaccination depends on the size of the households in which they reside, and acquaintance vaccination, which targets individuals of high degree in the social network. For both types of vaccination scheme, assuming a large population with few initial infectives, we derive a threshold parameter which determines whether or not a large outbreak can occur and also the probability of a large outbreak and the fraction of the population infected by a large outbreak. The performance of these schemes is studied numerically, focusing on the influence of the household size distribution and the degree distribution of the social network. We find that acquaintance vaccination can significantly outperform the best household-based scheme if the degree distribution of the social network is heavy-tailed. For household-based schemes, when the vaccine coverage is insufficient to prevent a major outbreak and the vaccine is imperfect, we find situations in which both the probability and size of a major outbreak under the scheme which minimises the threshold parameter are larger than in the scheme which maximises the threshold parameter.",

The spreading dynamics of the virus was analyzed. The spreading critical threshold for the model was presented. Theoretical analyses indicate that the outbreak of the virus is entirely determined by the threshold. Numerical simulations confirmed the analytical results. Introduction Internet provides conveniently various services and information to people. Meanwhile, the easy access and wide usage of Internet make it a primary target for viruses. In the past, outbreaks of computer viruses have brought about huge financial losses. As the major means of defending against viruses, antivirus software is more a technique than a science; it cannot predict the evolution of viruses and hence, cannot provide global prevention/control policies. With the dramatic increase in the number of virus, relying solely on measures to clear the viruses can not meet the ultimate needs. Facing the severe situation of virus\u2019 destroy, it\u2019s urgent for people to establish epidemic model, explore virus propagation characteristics and advance controlling schemes in the network information security field. The computer viruses bear a striking resemblance to their biological counterparts. Cohen [1] and Murray [2] inventively suggested to exploit the tools developed in epidemic dynamics of infectious diseases to study the spreading behavior of computer viruses. Following this idea, Kephart and White [3] established the first epidemic model of computer viruses. From then on, most epidemic models usually have been proposed based on the assumption that Internet is homogeneous network [4-6]. At the end of last century empirical studies report that Internet has scale-free properties [7-9]. Studies on epidemic spreading in SF networks present us with surprising result, such as absence of any epidemic threshold, hierarchical spread of epidemic outbreaks [10-12], and so on. Most previous work toward this direction was limited to three simplistic models: the SI model [13-14], the SIS model [15-16] and the SIR model [17-18]. However, most previous works mainly focus on the impact of the underlying topology and assume that the transmission is uniformly distributed among all links, that is, each infected individual will try to contact all its susceptible neighbors once within one time step. In fact, this kind of uniform transmission is induced from the assumption that each node\u2019s potential infectivity, counted by its possible maximal contribution to the propagation process within one time step, is strictly equal to its degree, i.e., \u2018infectivity\u2261degree\u2019. The node with very large degree is called hub in computer networks, whereas the node with great infectivity in epidemic contact networks is termed super-spreader. Thus, the above assumption means hub\u2261super-spreader. This assumption fails to consider that the infectivity of an infected computer is limited, because computer\u2019s processing capacity and network bandwidth are limited. In this paper, we aim to overlook the above defects and understand the spreading behaviors of computer viruses in Internet. We present a novel SIDS (susceptible-infected-detached-susceptible) epidemic model of computer virus to investigate the impact of nonlinear infectivity in Internet with the scale-free property. We obtain the corresponding spreading threshold and analyze the globally dynamic behaviors of the virus. Then, the numerical simulations are given, which are well consistent with the theoretical results. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we will briefly formulate this novel epidemic model. Then in Section 3, we determine the threshold value and analyze the International Conference on Information Sciences, Machinery, Materials and Energy (ICISMME 2015) \u00a9 2015. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 1684 globally dynamic behaviors of the virus. In Section 4, we carry out extensive numerical simulations to verify the theoretical analysis in Section 3. At last, in Section 5 we summarize this work. Model formulation It is well known [11-13] that the node degrees of Internet asymptotically follow a power law distribution, ( ) P k k \u03b3 \u2212 \ufffd , where ( ) P k stands for the probability that a node chosen randomly from Internet is of degree k . For this model in Internet, each computer is represented by a vertex of the network and the edges are communication links between them, along which the infection may spread. Let ( ) k S t , ( ) k I t and ( ) k D t be the densities of susceptible, infected, and quarantined vertexes of degree k at time t . Obviously, they must satisfy the normalized condition ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 k k k S t I t D t + + = if the total number of the node is fixed. The infection transmission is defined by the spreading rate\u03bb , at which each susceptible computer acquires the infection from an infected neighbor during one time step. An infected computer goes through a quarantine period firstly before becoming susceptible again. The rate constant of quarantine for infected computers is denoted by \u03bc . \u03c4 is the average quarantine period. All parameters are positive. Then by applying the mean-field technique to the above assumptions, we have the following dynamics model based on delay differential equations ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) k k k",

However, computer simulations can be slow to implement for newly emerging epidemics, delaying rapid exploration of different intervention scenarios, and do not immediately give general insights, for example, to identify the control strategy with a minimal socio-economic cost. Here, we resolve this problem by applying an analytical approximation to a general epidemiological, stochastic, spatially explicit SIR(S) model where the infection is dispersed according to a finite-ranged dispersal kernel. We derive analytical conditions for a pathogen to invade a spatially explicit host population and to become endemic. To derive general insights about the likely impact of optimal control strategies on invasion and persistence: first, we distinguish between \u2018spatial' and \u2018non-spatial' control measures, based on their impact on the dispersal kernel; second, we quantify the relative impact of control interventions on the epidemic; third, we consider the relative socio-economic cost of control interventions. Overall, our study shows a trade-off between the two types of control interventions and a vaccination strategy. We identify the optimal strategy to control invading and endemic diseases with minimal socio-economic cost across all possible parameter combinations. We also demonstrate the necessary characteristics of exit strategies from control interventions. The modelling framework presented here can be applied to a wide class of diseases in populations of humans, animals and plants.",

We focus here on the properties of forward reachable sets (FRS) as a function of the underlying degree distribution and edge duration. FRS are defined as the set of nodes that can be reached from an initial seed via a path of temporally ordered edges; a natural extension of connected component measures to dynamic networks. Working in a stochastic framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the exponential growth rate of the FRS for temporal networks with both edge and node dynamics. For networks with node dynamics, we calculate thresholds for the growth of the FRS. The effects of finite population size are explored via simulation and approximation. We examine how these properties vary by edge duration and different cross-sectional degree distributions that characterize a range of scientifically interesting normative outcomes (Poisson and Bernoulli). The size of the forward reachable set gives an upper bound for the epidemic size in disease transmission network models, relating this work to epidemic modeling (Ferguson, 2000; Eames, 2004).",

We show coexistence is impossible if network layers are identical yet possible if network layers are distinct. Not only do we rigorously prove a region of coexistence, but we can quantitate it via interrelation of central nodes across the network layers. Little to no overlapping of the layers' central nodes is the key determinant of coexistence.

Not only do we rigorously prove a region of coexistence, we quantitate it via interrelation of central nodes across the network layers. Little to no overlapping of layers central nodes is the key determinant of coexistence. Specifically, we show coexistence is impossible if network layers are identical yet possible if the network layers have distinct dominant eigenvectors and node degree vectors. For example, we show both analytically and numerically that positive correlation of network layers makes it difficult for a virus to survive while in a network with negatively correlated layers survival is easier but total removal of the other virus is more difficult. We believe our methodology has great potentials for application to broader classes of multi-pathogen spreading over multi-layer and interconnected networks.",

When it comes to competition between two such contagions spreading on overlaid graphs, their propagation is captured by so-called bi-virus epidemic models. Analysis of such dynamical systems involve the identification of equilibrium points and its convergence properties, which determine whether either of the viruses dies out, or both survive together. We demonstrate how the existing works are unsuccessful in characterizing a large subset of the model parameter space, including all parameters for which the competitiveness of the bi-virus system is significant enough to attain coexistence of the epidemics. In this paper, we fill in this void and obtain convergence results for the entirety of the model parameter space; giving precise conditions (necessary and sufficient) under which the system globally converges to a trichotomy of possible outcomes: a virus-free state, a single-virus state, and to a coexistence state \u2013 the first such result.",
