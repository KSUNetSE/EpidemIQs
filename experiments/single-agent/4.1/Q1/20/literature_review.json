                    "abstract": "Information regarding vaccines from sources such as health services, media, and social networks can significantly shape vaccination decisions. In particular, the dissemination of negative information can contribute to vaccine hesitancy, thereby exacerbating infectious disease outbreaks. This study investigates strategies to mitigate anti-vaccine social contagion through effective counter-campaigns that disseminate positive vaccine information and encourage vaccine uptake, aiming to reduce the size of epidemics. In a coupled agent-based model that consists of opinion and disease diffusion processes, we explore and compare different heuristics to design positive campaigns based on the network structure and local presence of negative vaccine attitudes. We examine two campaigning regimes: a static regime with a fixed set of targets, and a dynamic regime in which targets can be updated over time. We demonstrate that strategic targeting and engagement with the dynamics of anti-vaccine influence diffusion in the network can effectively mitigate the spread of anti-vaccine sentiment, thereby reducing the epidemic size. However, the effectiveness of the campaigns differs across different targeting strategies and is impacted by a range of factors. We find that the primary advantage of static campaigns lies in their capacity to act as an obstacle, preventing the clustering of emerging anti-vaccine communities, thereby resulting in smaller and unconnected anti-vaccine groups. On the other hand, dynamic campaigns reach a broader segment of the population and adapt to the evolution of anti-vaccine diffusion, not only protecting susceptible agents from negative influence but also fostering positive propagation within negative regions.",

                    "abstract": "Forecasting temporal processes such as virus spreading in epidemics often requires more than just observed time-series data, especially at the beginning of a wave when data is limited. Traditional methods employ mechanistic models like the SIR family, which make strong assumptions about the underlying spreading process, often represented as a small set of compact differential equations. Data-driven methods such as deep neural networks make no such assumptions and can capture the generative process in more detail, but fail in long-term forecasting due to data limitations. We propose a new hybrid method called MP-PINN (Multi-Phase Physics-Informed Neural Network) to overcome the limitations of these two major approaches. MP-PINN instils the spreading mechanism into a neural network, enabling the mechanism to update in phases over time, reflecting the dynamics of the epidemics due to policy interventions. Experiments on COVID-19 waves demonstrate that MP-PINN achieves superior performance over pure data-driven or model-driven approaches for both short-term and long-term forecasting.",

They are constructed as a 2-dimensional Newman and Watts model (500 \u00d7 500 square lattice with additional shortcuts), where the dynamics involves rewiring shortcuts in every time step of the epidemic spread. We assume susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model of the disease. We study the behaviour of the epidemic over the range of shortcut probability per underlying bond \u03d5 = 0\u20130.5. We calculate percolation thresholds for the epidemic outbreak, for which numerical results are checked against an approximate analytical model. We find a significant lowering of percolation thresholds on the dynamic network in the parameter range given. The result shows the behaviour of the epidemic on dynamic network is that of a static small world with the number of shortcuts increased by 20.7\u00b11.4 %, while the overall qualitative behaviour stays the same. We derive corrections to the analytical model which account for the effect. For both dynamic and static small worlds we observe suppression of the average epidemic size dependence on network size in comparison with the finite-size scaling known for regular lattice. We also study the effect of dynamics for several rewiring rates relative to infectious period of the disease.\n",

For example, currently, the debate continues to reveal when and where the first spread of COVID-19 occured. For this problem, most of the works have assumed a static network topology, that is, the connections between nodes do not change over time. This is impractical because many nodes have some mobility in the network, or the connections can be changed. In this paper, we focus on the dynamic network, in the sense that the node connectivity varies over time. We first introduce a simple dynamic model, named k-flip dynamic such that \n \n \n \n k \n > \n 0 \n \n \n \n connections in the network may be changed with some probability at each time. Next, we design a proper estimation algorithm using some investigation for the contact information between infected nodes, named dynamic network source estimation (DNSE)(k) for the dynamic model. We perform various simulations for the algorithm compared to several existing source estimation methods. Our results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms and is efficient for finding the epidemic source compared to other methods. Further, we see that the detection probability for our proposed algorithm can be above 45% when we use budget to investigate the contact information from the infected nodes under some practical setting of k.",

A simple extension of the Watts-Strogatz model is proposed to control the graph properties of the network such that the corresponding physical properties can be studied with simulations. The architecture of polymer networks assembled with a dynamic curing approach were compared with the extended Watts-Strogatz model, and found to agree surprisingly well. The final cured structures of the dynamically-assembled networks were nearly an intermediate between lattice and random connections due to restrictions imposed by the finite length of the chains. Further, the uni-axial stress response, character of the bond breaking, and non-affine displacements of fully-cured glassy networks were analyzed as a function of the degree of disorder in the network architecture. It is shown that the architecture strongly affects the network stability, flow stress, onset of bond breaking, and ultimate stress while leaving the modulus and yield point nearly unchanged. The results show that internal restrictions imposed by the network architecture alter the chain-level response through changes to the crosslink dynamics in the flow regime and through the degree of coordinated chain failure at the ultimate stress. The properties considered here are shown to be sensitive to even incremental changes to the architecture and, therefore, the overall network architecture, beyond simple defects, is predicted to be a meaningful physical parameter in the mechanics of glassy polymer networks.",

The results can provide guidance to public health authorities on comprehensive prevention and control for the new Mpox virus strain in the Democratic Republic of Congo as of December 2023. Methods We develop a two-layer Watts-Strogatz network model. The basic reproduction number is calculated using the next-generation matrix approach. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) optimization algorithm is used to fit Mpox cases in Canada into the network model. Numerical simulations are used to assess the impact of mitigation strategies and human behavior on the final epidemic size. Results Our results show that the contact transmission rate of low-risk groups and susceptible humans increases when the contact transmission rate of high-risk groups and susceptible humans is controlled as the Mpox epidemic spreads. The contact transmission rate of high-risk groups after May 18, 2022, is approximately 20% lower than that before May 18, 2022. Our findings indicate a positive correlation between the basic reproduction number and the level of heterogeneity in human contacts, with the basic reproduction number estimated at 2.3475 (95% CI: 0.0749\u20136.9084). Reducing the average number of sexual contacts to two per week effectively reduces the reproduction number to below one. Conclusion We need to pay attention to the re-emergence of the epidemics caused by low-risk groups when an outbreak dominated by high-risk groups is under control. Numerical simulations show that reducing the average number of sexual contacts to two per week is effective in slowing down the rapid spread of the epidemic. Our findings offer guidance for the public health authorities of the Democratic Republic of Congo in developing effective mitigation strategies.",
