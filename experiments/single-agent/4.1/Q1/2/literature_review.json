                    "abstract": "Information regarding vaccines from sources such as health services, media, and social networks can significantly shape vaccination decisions. In particular, the dissemination of negative information can contribute to vaccine hesitancy, thereby exacerbating infectious disease outbreaks. This study investigates strategies to mitigate anti-vaccine social contagion through effective counter-campaigns that disseminate positive vaccine information and encourage vaccine uptake, aiming to reduce the size of epidemics. In a coupled agent-based model that consists of opinion and disease diffusion processes, we explore and compare different heuristics to design positive campaigns based on the network structure and local presence of negative vaccine attitudes. We examine two campaigning regimes: a static regime with a fixed set of targets, and a dynamic regime in which targets can be updated over time. We demonstrate that strategic targeting and engagement with the dynamics of anti-vaccine influence diffusion in the network can effectively mitigate the spread of anti-vaccine sentiment, thereby reducing the epidemic size. However, the effectiveness of the campaigns differs across different targeting strategies and is impacted by a range of factors. We find that the primary advantage of static campaigns lies in their capacity to act as an obstacle, preventing the clustering of emerging anti-vaccine communities, thereby resulting in smaller and unconnected anti-vaccine groups. On the other hand, dynamic campaigns reach a broader segment of the population and adapt to the evolution of anti-vaccine diffusion, not only protecting susceptible agents from negative influence but also fostering positive propagation within negative regions.",

                    "abstract": "Forecasting temporal processes such as virus spreading in epidemics often requires more than just observed time-series data, especially at the beginning of a wave when data is limited. Traditional methods employ mechanistic models like the SIR family, which make strong assumptions about the underlying spreading process, often represented as a small set of compact differential equations. Data-driven methods such as deep neural networks make no such assumptions and can capture the generative process in more detail, but fail in long-term forecasting due to data limitations. We propose a new hybrid method called MP-PINN (Multi-Phase Physics-Informed Neural Network) to overcome the limitations of these two major approaches. MP-PINN instils the spreading mechanism into a neural network, enabling the mechanism to update in phases over time, reflecting the dynamics of the epidemics due to policy interventions. Experiments on COVID-19 waves demonstrate that MP-PINN achieves superior performance over pure data-driven or model-driven approaches for both short-term and long-term forecasting.",

They are constructed as a 2-dimensional Newman and Watts model (500 \u00d7 500 square lattice with additional shortcuts), where the dynamics involves rewiring shortcuts in every time step of the epidemic spread. We assume susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model of the disease. We study the behaviour of the epidemic over the range of shortcut probability per underlying bond \u03d5 = 0\u20130.5. We calculate percolation thresholds for the epidemic outbreak, for which numerical results are checked against an approximate analytical model. We find a significant lowering of percolation thresholds on the dynamic network in the parameter range given. The result shows the behaviour of the epidemic on dynamic network is that of a static small world with the number of shortcuts increased by 20.7\u00b11.4 %, while the overall qualitative behaviour stays the same. We derive corrections to the analytical model which account for the effect. For both dynamic and static small worlds we observe suppression of the average epidemic size dependence on network size in comparison with the finite-size scaling known for regular lattice. We also study the effect of dynamics for several rewiring rates relative to infectious period of the disease.\n",

For example, currently, the debate continues to reveal when and where the first spread of COVID-19 occured. For this problem, most of the works have assumed a static network topology, that is, the connections between nodes do not change over time. This is impractical because many nodes have some mobility in the network, or the connections can be changed. In this paper, we focus on the dynamic network, in the sense that the node connectivity varies over time. We first introduce a simple dynamic model, named k-flip dynamic such that \n \n \n \n k \n > \n 0 \n \n \n \n connections in the network may be changed with some probability at each time. Next, we design a proper estimation algorithm using some investigation for the contact information between infected nodes, named dynamic network source estimation (DNSE)(k) for the dynamic model. We perform various simulations for the algorithm compared to several existing source estimation methods. Our results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms and is efficient for finding the epidemic source compared to other methods. Further, we see that the detection probability for our proposed algorithm can be above 45% when we use budget to investigate the contact information from the infected nodes under some practical setting of k.",

A simple extension of the Watts-Strogatz model is proposed to control the graph properties of the network such that the corresponding physical properties can be studied with simulations. The architecture of polymer networks assembled with a dynamic curing approach were compared with the extended Watts-Strogatz model, and found to agree surprisingly well. The final cured structures of the dynamically-assembled networks were nearly an intermediate between lattice and random connections due to restrictions imposed by the finite length of the chains. Further, the uni-axial stress response, character of the bond breaking, and non-affine displacements of fully-cured glassy networks were analyzed as a function of the degree of disorder in the network architecture. It is shown that the architecture strongly affects the network stability, flow stress, onset of bond breaking, and ultimate stress while leaving the modulus and yield point nearly unchanged. The results show that internal restrictions imposed by the network architecture alter the chain-level response through changes to the crosslink dynamics in the flow regime and through the degree of coordinated chain failure at the ultimate stress. The properties considered here are shown to be sensitive to even incremental changes to the architecture and, therefore, the overall network architecture, beyond simple defects, is predicted to be a meaningful physical parameter in the mechanics of glassy polymer networks.",

The results can provide guidance to public health authorities on comprehensive prevention and control for the new Mpox virus strain in the Democratic Republic of Congo as of December 2023. Methods We develop a two-layer Watts-Strogatz network model. The basic reproduction number is calculated using the next-generation matrix approach. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) optimization algorithm is used to fit Mpox cases in Canada into the network model. Numerical simulations are used to assess the impact of mitigation strategies and human behavior on the final epidemic size. Results Our results show that the contact transmission rate of low-risk groups and susceptible humans increases when the contact transmission rate of high-risk groups and susceptible humans is controlled as the Mpox epidemic spreads. The contact transmission rate of high-risk groups after May 18, 2022, is approximately 20% lower than that before May 18, 2022. Our findings indicate a positive correlation between the basic reproduction number and the level of heterogeneity in human contacts, with the basic reproduction number estimated at 2.3475 (95% CI: 0.0749\u20136.9084). Reducing the average number of sexual contacts to two per week effectively reduces the reproduction number to below one. Conclusion We need to pay attention to the re-emergence of the epidemics caused by low-risk groups when an outbreak dominated by high-risk groups is under control. Numerical simulations show that reducing the average number of sexual contacts to two per week is effective in slowing down the rapid spread of the epidemic.

                    "abstract": "Connecting the different scales of epidemic dynamics, from individuals to communities to nations, remains one of the main challenges of disease modeling. Here, we revisit one of the largest public health efforts deployed against a localized epidemic: the 2014-2016 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic in Sierra Leone. We leverage the data collected by the surveillance and contact tracing protocols of the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other responding partners to validate a network epidemiology framework connecting the population (incidence), community (local forecasts), and individual (secondary infections) scales of disease transmission. In doing so, we gain a better understanding of what brought the EVD epidemic to an end: Reduction of introduction in new clusters (primary cases), and not reduction in local transmission patterns (secondary infections). We also find that the first 90 days of the epidemic contained enough information to produce probabilistic forecasts of EVD cases; forecasts which we show are confirmed independently by both disease surveillance and contact tracing. Altogether, using data available two months before the start of the international support to the local response, network epidemiology could have inferred heterogeneity in local transmissions, the risk for superspreading events, and probabilistic forecasts of eventual cases per community. We expect that our framework will help connect large data collection efforts with individual behavior, and help reduce uncertainty during health emergencies and emerging epidemics. Infectious diseases are constant yet often unpredictable threats. The 2014-2016 EVD epidemic in West Africa alone took over ten thousand lives and led to aid distributions nearing $10 billion from 70 countries1. There were two major contributing factors: (i) local health systems were ill-prepared, with Ebola-affected countries falling at least 90% short of WHO recommendations for numbers of doctors and nurses per capita2; and (ii) the declaration of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern came late: over 4 months after the first international transmission event3. This last systemic failure likely reflects the fact that EVD outbreaks, like most emerging outbreaks, are highly unpredictable and variable. Before 2014, recent Ebola outbreaks occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2014 and 2012, South Sudan in 2004, Gabon in 2001, and notably in Uganda in 2012 and 2007, but these never exceeded 500 geographically contained cases4. In stark contrast, there were nearly 30,000 cases over 10 countries during the West African epidemic with widespread transmission in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and other cases in Italy, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The spread and impact of EVD spread is determined not only by the biology of the virus but also in large part by societal and behavioral factors5, 6. Consequently, in the country that reported the most number of cases and deaths, Sierra Leone, the intervention aimed to alleviate disease burden on a strained healthcare system focused on supportive care7 by investing significantly in behavioral interventions ranging from community engagement8 to traditional contact tracing9. As we will see, ar X iv :2 11 1. 08 68 6v 1 [ qbi o. PE ] 1 6 N ov 2 02 1 the latter revealed the variability of Ebola transmissions, suggesting that less than 5% of Ebola cases caused more than one secondary infection over the course of the epidemic, yet some individuals infected dozens of others. We can now leverage the data collected in these efforts to develop the next generation of epidemic forecasting tools through a first study of the unique ethical and anonymized Sierra Leone Ebola Database (SLED), which consolidates data from the Government of Sierra Leone and a range of responding partners10, 11. Here, we present case and contact tracing data from SLED. We first show that distributions of secondary infections (or transmissions) per case did not change significantly over time and that reduction in the spread of EVD was likely due to a reduction in its introduction in new communities. To validate these data, we then show that network epidemiology models informed by contact-tracing data can provide probabilistic forecasts of epidemics at the village level, capturing the heterogeneity of disease spread as well as its randomness. This network approach contrasts with the traditional deterministic forecasts from conventional compartmental models whose only uncertainty stems from parameter confidence rather than from the intrinsic randomness of epidemics. Importantly, we also show how to infer valuable individual-level contact statistics from population-level incidence data. Our network epidemiology framework helps us better understand the dynamics of EVD in Sierra Leone. It also opens the way to multi-scale inference of epidemic dynamics, connecting population incidence, probabilistic forecasts in communities, and individual-level heterogeneity. One key obstacle that precluded previous validation of models accounting for individual heterogeneity is the rarity of multi-scale data. Most epidemic data are coarse-grained over large populations (e.g. nations, states, etc.), while models often require individual level data (e.g. distribution of secondary infections or contact patterns) to provide forecasts at the level of communities (e.g., villages or towns). In that respect, the large contact tracing and data collection efforts accomplished during the EVD epidemic in Sierra Leone are unique in their scale and quality. During the West African EVD epidemic, contact tracing efforts were sustained to varying degree but spanned the entire epidemic13, see Fig. 1. These efforts followed the guidelines of the World Health Organization on how to establish and conduct contact tracing during filovirus disease outbreaks9. Therein, contact tracing is defined as the identification and follow-up of persons who may have come into contact with an infected individual. Identification is done by investigating high-risk categories of contacts, which include but are not limited to individuals who: (i) touched an infected patient\u2019s body fluids (blood, vomit, saliva, urine, faeces), (ii) had direct physical contact with the body of a patient (alive or dead), (iii) touched or cleaned the linens or clothes of a patient, (iv) were laboratory workers who had direct contact with specimens collected from suspected Ebola patients without appropriate infection prevention and control measures, or (v) were patients who received care in a hospital where EVD patients were treated before the initiation of strict isolation and infection prevention and control measures. For disease modeling and forecasting, several key insights can be extracted from contact tracing data 14: Identifying the critical types of contacts, settings and mechanisms that promote transmission, inferring the frequency of superspreading events, and so on. The distribution of secondary infections identified through contact tracing around a given index case also reflects the heterogeneity of disease spread15, 16. In particular, the average number of secondary infections directly reflects the basic reproduction number R0 of the epidemic, which is often the sole focus of disease models ignoring the richness and heterogeneity of the underlying distribution. For the EVD epidemic in Sierra Leone, the distribution of secondary infections collected through contact tracing is shown for three key periods of the epidemic in Fig. 1. First, we note the absence of data regarding cases that did not cause any secondary infections. This is a direct shortcoming of the data collection which did not distinguish between cases where contact tracing efforts did not identify secondary infections and cases where there were no contact tracing efforts whatsoever. Second, the observed distributions show significant heterogeneity, stressing the need to account for more than simply their average (e.g., R0). In individuals at the source of at least one transmission event, we find an average of roughly 1.6 secondary infections in all three periods (1.624, 1.622, and 1.660 respectively). Yet, out of cases that do transmit the disease, 85% lead to a single secondary infection while at least 1 in a thousand cases leads to 10 infections or more. It is therefore dangerous to assume that the EVD epidemic was driven by average individuals. The majority of cases create fewer secondary infections than the average, while a minority create an order of magnitude more infections than average16, 17. Third, and perhaps most strikingly, the distribution of secondary infections do not statistically-significantly change across the three observed periods. These periods \u2014 May through September 2014, October to mid-November 2014, and onward \u2014 were chosen to contain similar numbers of contact tracing data but also roughly correspond to the onset of the epidemic peak, the epidemic peak itself, and the decay of the epidemic. One could reasonably assume that the large public health efforts which helped limit the spread of EVD would here be reflected as a decrease in the frequency of higher numbers of secondary infections. However, while public health efforts did reduce mortality 75 to 40%7, 18, they did not appear to influence the distribution of secondary infections as observed through contact tracing. This is a surprising result considering the scale of epidemic control efforts. We thus aim to validate this distribution of secondary infections. Are these contact tracing data reliable enough to inform epidemic models and forecasts? The contact tracing data is of course not perfect, with probable biases around the fact that",

The extent of these bifurcations is modulated by the graph heterogeneity, the recovery parameter, and the network size. In the limit of large, well-mixed networks, the behavior approaches that of difference equation models, suggesting this behavior is a universal feature of all discrete-time SIR models.

Recently, network-based disease models have integrated traditional compartment-based modeling with real-world contact graphs and shown promising results. However, in an ongoing epidemic, future contact network patterns are not observed yet. To address this, we use aggregated static networks to approximate future contacts for disease modeling. The standard method in the literature concatenates all edges from a dynamic graph into one collapsed graph, called the full static graph. However, the full static graph often leads to severe overestimation of key epidemic characteristics. Therefore, we propose two novel static network approximation methods, DegMST and EdgeMST, designed to preserve the sparsity of real world contact network while remaining connected. DegMST and EdgeMST use the frequency of temporal edges and the node degrees respectively to preserve sparsity. Our analysis show that our models more closely resemble the network characteristics of the dynamic graph compared to the full static ones. Moreover, our analysis on seven real-world contact networks suggests EdgeMST yield more accurate estimations of disease dynamics for epidemic forecasting when compared to the standard full static method.",

In particular, the dissemination of negative information can contribute to vaccine hesitancy, thereby exacerbating infectious disease outbreaks. This study investigates strategies to mitigate anti-vaccine social contagion through effective counter-campaigns that disseminate positive vaccine information and encourage vaccine uptake, aiming to reduce the size of epidemics. In a coupled agent-based model that consists of opinion and disease diffusion processes, we explore and compare different heuristics to design positive campaigns based on the network structure and local presence of negative vaccine attitudes. We examine two campaigning regimes: a static regime with a fixed set of targets, and a dynamic regime in which targets can be updated over time. We demonstrate that strategic targeting and engagement with the dynamics of anti-vaccine influence diffusion in the network can effectively mitigate the spread of anti-vaccine sentiment, thereby reducing the epidemic size. However, the effectiveness of the campaigns differs across different targeting strategies and is impacted by a range of factors. We find that the primary advantage of static campaigns lies in their capacity to act as an obstacle, preventing the clustering of emerging anti-vaccine communities, thereby resulting in smaller and unconnected anti-vaccine groups. On the other hand, dynamic campaigns reach a broader segment of the population and adapt to the evolution of anti-vaccine diffusion, not only protecting susceptible agents from negative influence but also fostering positive propagation within negative regions.",

The model allows us to simulate various scenarios to understand how epidemic spreading can be affected by misinformation spreading through one particular social media platform. Using this model, we compare a worst-case scenario, in which individuals become misinformed after a single exposure to low-credibility content, to a best-case scenario where the population is highly resilient to misinformation.

One layer embodies face-to-face contacts, with a biological infection transmission following a simple contagion model, the SIR process. Awareness, modelled by the linear threshold model, a complex contagion, spreads over a social layer and induces behaviour that lowers the chance of a biological infection occurring. It may be provoked by the presence of either aware or infectious neighbours. We introduce a novel model combining these influences through a convex combination, creating a continuum between pure social contagion and local risk perception. Simulation of the model shows distinct effects arising from the awareness sources. Also, for convex combinations where both input sources are of importance, awareness cascades that are not attributable to only one of these sources, emerge.

Our models can be viewed as an extension to classic SIR models, to which a distinct Asymptomatic compartment is added. We discuss both a group compartment model capturing a Susceptible-Asymptomatic-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SAIRS) epidemic process, and also introduce and evaluate SAIRS dynamics evolving over networks. We investigate equilibria and stability properties that include both disease-free and endemic equilibria states for these models, providing sufficient conditions for convergence to these equilibria. Model parameter estimation results based on local test-site and Peoria county clinic data are given, and a number of simulations illustrating the effects of asymptomatic-infected individuals and network structure on the spread and/or persistence of the disease are presented.",

                    "abstract": "Aim/Purpose: The understanding of disease spread dynamics in the context of air travel is crucial for effective disease detection and epidemic intelligence. The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Hospitalized-Critical-Deaths (SEIR-HCD) model proposed in this research work is identified as a valuable tool for capturing the complex dynamics of disease transmission, healthcare demands, and mortality rates during epidemics.\n\nBackground: The spread of viral diseases is a major problem for public health services all over the world. Understanding how diseases spread is important in order to take the right steps to stop them. In epidemiology, the SIS, SIR, and SEIR models have been used to mimic and study how diseases spread in groups of people.\n\nMethodology: This research focuses on the integration of air traffic network data into the SEIR-HCD model to enhance the understanding of disease spread in air travel settings. By incorporating air traffic data, the model considers the role of travel patterns and connectivity in disease dissemination, enabling the identification of high-risk routes, airports, and regions.\n\nContribution: This research contributes to the field of epidemiology by enhancing our understanding of disease spread dynamics through the application of the SIS, SIR, and SEIR-HCD models. The findings provide insights into the factors influencing disease transmission, allowing for the development of effective strategies for disease control and prevention.\n\nFindings: The interplay between local outbreaks and global disease dissemination through air travel is empirically explored. The model can be further used for the evaluation of the effectiveness of surveillance and early detection measures at airports and transportation hubs. The proposed research contributes to proactive and evidence-based strategies for disease prevention and control, offering insights into the impact of air travel on disease transmission and supporting public health interventions in air traffic networks.\n\nRecommendations for Practitioners: Government intervention can be studied during difficult times which plays as a moderating variable that can enhance or hinder the efficacy of epidemic intelligence efforts within air traffic networks. Expert collaboration from various fields, including epidemiology, aviation, data science, and public health with an interdisciplinary approach can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the disease spread dynamics in air traffic networks. \n\nRecommendation for Researchers: Researchers can collaborate with international health organizations and authorities to share their research findings and contribute to a global understanding of disease spread in air traffic networks.\n\nImpact on Society: This research has significant implications for society. By providing a deeper understanding of disease spread dynamics, it enables policymakers, public health officials, and practitioners to make informed decisions to mitigate disease outbreaks. The recommendations derived from this research can aid in the development of effective strategies to control and prevent the spread of infectious diseases, ultimately leading to improved public health outcomes and reduced societal disruptions.\n\nFuture Research: Practitioners of the research can contribute more effectively to disease outbreaks within the context of air traffic networks, ultimately helping to protect public health and global travel. By considering air traffic patterns, the SEIR-HCD model contributes to more accurate modeling and prediction of disease outbreaks, aiding in the development of proactive and evidence-based strategies to manage and mitigate the impact of infectious diseases in the context of air travel.\n\n",

Here, we incorporate the aforementioned heterogeneities into a model by considering a dual-layer static\u2013dynamic multiplex network. The static network layer affords tunable clustering and describes an individual\u2019s permanent community structure. The dynamic network layer describes the transient connections an individual makes with members of the wider population by imposing constant edge rewiring. We follow the edge-based compartmental modelling approach to derive equations describing the evolution of a susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered epidemic spreading through this multiplex network of individuals. We derive the basic reproduction number, measuring the expected number of new infectious cases caused by a single infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population. We validate model equations by showing convergence to pre-existing edge-based compartmental model equations in limiting cases and by comparison with stochastically simulated epidemics. We explore the effects of altering model parameters and multiplex network attributes on resultant epidemic dynamics. We validate the basic reproduction number by plotting its value against associated final epidemic sizes measured from simulation and predicted by model equations for a number of set-ups. Further, we explore the effect of varying individual model parameters on the basic reproduction number. We conclude with a discussion of the significance and interpretation of the model and its relation to existing research literature. We highlight intrinsic limitations and potential extensions of the present model and outline future research considerations, both experimental and theoretical.",
