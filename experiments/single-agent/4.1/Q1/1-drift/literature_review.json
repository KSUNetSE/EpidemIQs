                    "abstract": "The present paper studies a fractional\u2010order SEIR epidemic model for the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases such as HIV and HBV that spreads in the host population. The total host population is considered bounded, and Holling type\u2010II saturation incidence rate is involved as the infection term. Using the proposed SEIR epidemic model, the threshold quantity, namely, basic reproduction number R0 , is obtained that determines the status of the disease, whether it dies out or persists in the whole population. The model's analysis shows that two equilibria exist, namely, disease\u2010free equilibrium (DFE) and endemic equilibrium (EE). The global stability of the equilibria is determined using a Lyapunov functional approach. The disease status can be verified based on obtained threshold quantity R0 . If R0<1 , then DFE is globally stable, leading to eradicating the population's disease. If R0>1 , a unique EE exists, and that is globally stable under certain conditions in the feasible region. The Caputo type fractional derivative is taken as the fractional operator. The bifurcation and sensitivity analyses are also performed for the proposed model that determines the relative importance of the parameters in disease transmission. The numerical solution of the model is obtained by the generalized Adams\u2013Bashforth\u2013Moulton method. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to illustrate and verify the analytical results. From the obtained results, it is concluded that the order of the fractional derivative plays a significant role in the dynamic process. Also, from the sensitivity analysis results, it is seen that the parameter \u03b4 ( infection rate) is positively correlated to R0 , while the parameter \u03bc (inhibition rate) is negatively correlated to R0 , which means these parameters are more sensitive than others in disease dynamics.",

The population is categorized into four distinct groups: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), and recovered (R) individuals. The symmetric model integrates a bilinear incidence rate alongside a nonlinear recovery rate that depends on the quality of healthcare services. Additionally, it accounts for the impact of fear related to the disease and includes a constant vaccination rate as well as a nonlinear treatment function. The model advances current epidemiological frameworks by simultaneously accounting for these interrelated mechanisms, which are typically studied in isolation. We derive the expression for the basic reproduction number and analyze the essential stability properties of the model. Key analytical results demonstrate that the system exhibits rich dynamic behavior, including backward bifurcation (where stable endemic equilibria persist even when the basic reproduction number is less than one) and Hopf bifurcation. These phenomena emerge from the interplay between fear-induced suppression of transmission, treatment saturation, and healthcare quality. Numerical simulations using Saudi Arabian demographic and epidemiological data quantify how increased fear perception shrinks the bistability region, facilitating eradication. Healthcare capacity improvements, on the other hand, reduce the critical reproduction number threshold while treatment accessibility suppresses infection loads. The model\u2019s practical significance lies in its ability to identify intervention points where small parameter changes yield disproportionate control benefits and evaluate trade-offs between pharmaceutical (vaccination/treatment) and non-pharmaceutical (fear-driven distancing) strategies.

We use this to show that a (suitably defined) mean-field prediction always overestimates the outbreak size, and that the outbreak sizes for SIR and SEIR processes with the same initial condition and constant infection and recovery rates coincide. In contrast, we show that the outbreak sizes for SIR and SEIR processes with the same time-varying infection and recovery rates can in general be quite different.

                    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the fragility of the world in addressing a global health threat. The available resources of the pre-pandemic national health systems were inadequate to cope with the huge number of infected subjects needing health care and with the rapidity of the infection spread characterizing the COVID-19 outbreak. Indeed, an adequate allocation of the resources could produce in principle a strong reduction of the infection spread and of the hospital burden, preventing the collapse of the health system. In this work, taking inspiration from the COVID-19 and the difficulties in facing the emergency, an optimal problem of resource allocation is formulated on the basis of an ODE multi-group model composed by a network of SEIR-like submodels. The multi-group structure allows to differentiate the epidemic response of different populations or of various subgroups in the same population. In fact, an epidemic does not affect all populations in the same way, and even within the same population there can be epidemiological differences, like the susceptibility to the virus, the level of infectivity of the infectious subjects and the recovery from the disease. The subgroups are selected within the total population based on some peculiar characteristics, like for instance age, work, social condition, geographical position, etc., and they are connected by a network of contacts that allows the virus circulation within and among the groups. The proposed optimal control problem aims at defining a suitable monitoring campaign that is able to optimally allocate the number of swab tests between the subgroups of the population in order to reduce the number of infected patients (especially the most fragile ones) so reducing the epidemic impact on the health system. The proposed monitoring strategy can be applied both during the most critical phases of the emergency and in endemic conditions, when an active surveillance could be crucial for preventing the contagion rise.",

                    "abstract": "Objective To develop a spatially accurate biosurveillance synthetic data generator for the testing, evaluation, and comparison of new outbreak detection techniques. Introduction Development of new methods for the rapid detection of emerging disease outbreaks is a research priority in the field of biosurveillance. Because real-world data are often proprietary in nature, scientists must utilize synthetic data generation methods to evaluate new detection methodologies. Colizza et. al. have shown that epidemic spread is dependent on the airline transportation network [1], yet current data generators do not operate over network structures. Here we present a new spatial data generator that models the spread of contagion across a network of cities connected by airline routes. The generator is developed in the R programming language and produces data compatible with the popular `surveillance\u2019 software package. Methods Colizza et. al. demonstrate the power-law relationships between city population, air traffic, and degree distribution [1]. We generate a transportation network as a Chung-Lu random graph [2] that preserves these scale-free relationships (Figure 1). First, given a power-law exponent and a desired number of cities, a probability mass function (PMF) is generated that mirrors the expected degree distribution for the given power-law relationship. Values are then sampled from this PMF to generate an expected degree (number of connected cities) for each city in the network. Edges (airline connections) are added to the network probabilistically as described in [2]. Unconnected graph components are each joined to the largest component using linear preferential attachment. Finally, city sizes are calculated based on an observed three-quarter power- law scaling relationship with the sampled degree distribution. Each city is represented as a customizable stochastic compartmental SIR model. Transportation between cities is modeled similar to [2]. An infection is initialized in a single random city and infection counts are recorded in each city for a fixed period of time. A consistent fraction of the modeled infection cases are recorded as daily clinic visits. These counts are then added onto statically generated baseline data for each city to produce a full synthetic data set. Alternatively, data sets can be generated using real-world networks, such as the one maintained by the International Air Transport Association. Results Dynamics such as the number of cities, degree distribution power- law exponent, traffic flow, and disease kinetics can be customized. In the presented example (Figure 2) the outbreak spreads over a 20 city transportation network. Infection spreads rapidly once the more populated hub cities are infected. Cities that are multiple flights away from the initially infected city are infected late in the process. The generator is capable of creating data sets of arbitrary size, length, and connectivity to better mirror a diverse set of observed network types. Conclusions New computational methods for outbreak detection and surveillance must be compared to established approaches. Outbreak mitigation strategies require a realistic model of human transportation behavior to best evaluate impact. These actions require test data that accurately reflect the complexity of the real-world data they would be applied to. The outbreak data generated here represents the complexity of modern transportation networks and are made to be easily integrated with established software packages to allow for rapid testing and deployment. Randomly generated scale-free transportation network with a power-law degree exponent of \u03bb =1.8. City and link sizes are scaled to reflect their weight. An example of observed daily outbreak-related clinic visits across a randomly generated network of 20 cities. Each city is colored by the number of flights required to reach the city from the initial infection location. These generated counts are then added onto baseline data to create a synthetic data set for experimentation. Keywords Simulation; Network; Spatial; Synthetic; Data",

It is well known that treatment can have a specific effect on the spread of epidemics, and due to the limited resources of treatment, the number of patients during severe disease outbreaks who need to be treated may exceed the treatment capacity. Consequently, the number of patients who receive treatment will reach a saturation level. Thus, we incorporated a saturated treatment function into the model to characterize such a phenomenon. The dynamics of the present model is discussed in this paper. We first obtained a threshold value R0, which determines the stability of a disease-free equilibrium. Furthermore, we investigated the bifurcation behavior at R0=1. More specifically, we derived a condition that determines the direction of bifurcation at R0=1. If the direction is backward, then a stable disease-free equilibrium concurrently exists with a stable endemic equilibrium even though R0<1. Therefore, in this case, R0<1 is not sufficient to eradicate the disease from the population.

Based on the results, we calculate centrality metrics reflecting the outcome of the application, highlighting its important properties.

Results are compared with those for a calibrated unweighted graph. The degree distributions are based on both theoretical constructs and empirical network data. In addition, bivariate standard normal copulas are used to model the dependence between the degrees of the two edge types, allowing for modeling the correlation between edge types over a wide range. Among the results are that the weighted graph produces much richer results than the unweighted graph. Also, while R0 always increases with increasing correlation between the two degrees, this is not necessarily true for the probability of a major outbreak nor for the relative final size of a major outbreak.

The eradication or inhibition of the virus can be achieved through the spread of its opposite party. Here, we put forward an immunization strategy whose implementation does not depend on the analysis of network topology. The immunization agents are randomly placed on a few of individuals of network and spread out from these individuals on network in a propagation method. The immunization agents prevent virus infecting their habitat nodes with certain immune success rate.

The integration of these two confounding elements is generally ascertained through numerical simulation. Here, for the first time, we develop a more rigorous analytical understanding based on pairwise approximations to incorporate localized spatial structure and diffusion approximations to capture the impact of stochasticity. Our results allow us to quantify, analytically, the impact of network structure on the variability of an epidemic. Using the susceptible\u2013infectious\u2013susceptible framework for the infection dynamics, the pairwise stochastic model is compared with the stochastic homogeneous-mixing (mean-field) model\u2014although to enable a fair comparison the homogeneous-mixing parameters are scaled to give agreement with the pairwise dynamics. At equilibrium, we show that the pairwise model always displays greater variation about the mean, although the differences are generally small unless the prevalence of infection is low. By contrast, during the early epidemic growth phase when the level of infection is increasing exponentially, the pairwise model generally shows less variation.",

This has been possible due to the proliferation of data and the development of new methods to gather, mine and analyze it. A key role has also been played by the latest advances in new disciplines like network science. Nonetheless, current models still lack a faithful representation of all possible heterogeneities and features that can be extracted from data. Here, we bridge a current gap in the mathematical modeling of infectious diseases and develop a framework that allows to account simultaneously for both the connectivity of individuals and the age-structure of the population. We compare different scenarios, namely, i) the homogeneous mixing setting, ii) one in which only the social mixing is taken into account, iii) a setting that considers the connectivity of individuals alone, and finally, iv) a multilayer representation in which both the social mixing and the number of contacts are included in the model. We analytically show that the thresholds obtained for these four scenarios are different. In addition, we conduct extensive numerical simulations and conclude that heterogeneities in the contact network are important for a proper determination of the epidemic threshold, whereas the age-structure plays a bigger role beyond the onset of the outbreak. Altogether, when it comes to evaluate interventions such as vaccination, both sources of individual heterogeneity are important and should be concurrently considered. Our results also provide an indication of the errors incurred in situations in which one cannot access all needed information in terms of connectivity and age of the population.",

This paper proposes a class of collision resolution schemes for 802.11 having contention window control with nonoverlapped contention slots. In the first scheme, window ranges of two consecutive stages are nonoverlapped, and it is called nonoverlapped contention slots (NOCS) scheme. In the other scheme, termed as NOCS-offset, an offset is introduced between window ranges of two stages. Selection of a random value by a station for its contention with discontinuous distribution results in reduced probability of collision.

                    "abstract": "In ref. 1, an epidemiological model based on the smallworld (2) contact network and the SIR (susceptibleinfected-recovered) infection dynamics is analyzed and compared with the classical (well-mixed) SIR model. The authors claim that they observe a \u201ca hitherto unobserved transition from linear growth to S-shaped infection curves.\u201d This is rather surprising in the context of previous literature studying similar models (3\u20139). While scale-free networks (10) were reported to give rise to nonstandard features, including the absence of a nontrivial epidemic threshold and an algebraic spreading growth (6\u20138), no such abnormalities were observed on small-world networks (3\u20135, 7). Indeed, in the following, we show that the analysis presented in the paper (1) is flawed. The problem lies in the order parameter O= SD\u00f0C\u00f0t\u00de\u00de, the standard deviation of new daily cases (excluding days with no new cases), which is used to signal the postulated transition between an S-shaped growth (O> 0) and a linear growth (O\u2248 0). In reality, O can attain values close to zero for two distinct reasons: 1) C\u00f0t\u00de is constant (corresponding to a linear growth of the cumulative number of cases) as the authors claim, or 2) C\u00f0t\u00de exhibits low values, signaling that the epidemic is not able to effectively spread in the population and the number of cases drops exponentially, corresponding to the basic reproduction number R0 taking a value below one. Case 2, which is in line with the prediction of the classical SIR model, was never considered in ref. 1; both theoretical and numerical calculations established the existence of a critical point, but no evidence was reported for the existence of the postulated linear growth phase below the critical point. We hypothesized that case 2 is the mechanism yielding O\u2248 0 below the critical point. To test this, we independently simulated the model introduced in ref. 1. First, we verified that O signals a continuous transition between two distinct phases (Fig. 1A). Second, we calculated the basic reproduction number R0 (Fig. 1B), which confirmed that, below the critical point, an infection does not spread through the network, consistent with case 2. Third, we calculated the outbreak duration Tend, which exhibits a sharp maximum at the critical point and drops especially quickly below the critical point (Fig. 1C). Because Tend upperbounds the possible duration of a linear growth, this result indicates that prolonged linear growth is impossible even slightly below the critical point. Last, we compared the evolution of the cumulative number of infections obtained from the small-world model and the classical SIR model (Fig. 1D). Already slightly below the critical point, the growth curve of the network model is significantly sublinear, as expected from the classical picture. In conclusion, the presented results corroborate our supposition that the linear growth in the cumulative number of infections is restricted to the vicinity of the critical point. Furthermore, we checked that the results are very similar on Erd} os\u2013R\u00e9nyi networks (Fig. 2). Thus, the model introduced in ref. 1 does not predict that nor explain why \u201cmost COVID-19 infection curves are linear.\u201d",
