                    "abstract": "BackgroundConfirmed H1N1 cases during late spring and summer 2009 in various countries showed a substantial age shift between importations and local transmission cases, with adults mainly responsible for seeding unaffected regions and children most frequently driving community outbreaks.MethodsWe introduce a multi-host stochastic metapopulation model with two age classes to analytically investigate the role of a heterogeneously mixing population and its associated non-homogeneous travel behaviors on the risk of a major epidemic. We inform the model with demographic data, contact data and travel statistics of Europe and Mexico, and calibrate it to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic early outbreak. We allow for variations of the model parameters to explore the conditions of invasion under different scenarios.ResultsWe derive the expression for the potential of global invasion of the epidemic that depends on the transmissibility of the pathogen, the transportation network and mobility features, the demographic profile and the mixing pattern. Higher assortativity in the contact pattern greatly increases the probability of spatial containment of the epidemic, this effect being contrasted by an increase in the social activity of adults vs. children. Heterogeneous features of the mobility network characterizing its topology and traffic flows strongly favor the invasion of the pathogen at the spatial level, as also a larger fraction of children traveling. Variations in the demographic profile and mixing habits across countries lead to heterogeneous outbreak situations. Model results are compatible with the H1N1 spatial transmission dynamics observed.ConclusionsThis work illustrates the importance of considering age-dependent mixing profiles and mobility features coupled together to study the conditions for the spatial invasion of an emerging influenza pandemic. Its results allow the immediate assessment of the risk of a major epidemic for a specific scenario upon availability of data, and the evaluation of the potential effectiveness of public health interventions targeting specific age groups, their interactions and mobility behaviors. The approach provides a general modeling framework that can be used for other types of partitions of the host population and applied to different settings.",

In this model, (N) represents non-believers, (E) denotes individuals exposed to the information but undecided, (A) refers to those who accept the information and may propagate it, and (B) are the believers. Similar to epidemiological models like SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered), the NEAB model adapts to study the spread of various types of information and behaviors within a population [20]. By combining elements of network theory [28] and epidemiology, the model investigates how behaviors and network structures influence information transmission. Our simulations, particularly when applied to real-world scenarios like misinformation spread during events such as COVID-19 or natural disasters, highlight key factors influencing dissemination [7]. Rates of exposure to misinformation, the transition of individuals from exposed to active spreaders, and the rate of recovery all play crucial roles in shaping how misinformation spreads [33]. Misinformation propagates more easily when exposure rates are high, while higher recovery rates help limit its spread. Sensitivity analysis shows that variations in (\u03b2) and (\u03b4) significantly impact the spread, emphasizing the importance of targeted interventions during these critical stages [22]. The objective of this study is to evaluate strategies for reducing the effects of misinformation on public discourse and health outcomes while offering insights into the key factors that drive its dissemination based on model simulations.",

This study adopts a stochastic model to capture random variability in individual interactions, often overlooked in deterministic models. The population is divided into four main categories: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), and Recovered (R), with transitions between categories determined by probabilities based on epidemiological parameters. Through simulations, the model demonstrates its capability to depict more realistic patterns of disease spread, including fluctuations in case numbers and epidemic duration. The findings indicate that stochastic variability plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of tuberculosis transmission, especially in small populations or when the number of individual contacts is limited. The stochastic SEIR model can serve as an effective tool for policymakers to evaluate various intervention strategies, such as vaccination, transmission control, and treatment, as well as to design public health policies that are data-driven and adaptive to epidemiological uncertainties.",

The model combines the randomness of disease transmission and the nonlinearity of transmission rate, providing a flexible framework for more accurate description of the process of infectious disease transmission. On the basis of the discussion of the deterministic model, the stochastic semi-parametric SEIR model is studied. Firstly, we use Lyapunov analysis to prove the existence and uniqueness of global positive solutions for the model. Secondly, the conditions for disease extinction are established, and appropriate stochastic Lyapunov functions are constructed to discuss the asymptotic behavior of the model\u2019s solution at the disease-free equilibrium point of the deterministic model.

In particular, we introduce modifications to this model to account for the potential changes in behavior patterns of individuals upon becoming symptomatic, as well as the tendency of a substantial proportion of those infected to remain asymptomatic. Methods: Using a generic network model where every potential contact exists with the same common probability, we conduct a simulation study in which we vary four key model parameters (transmission rate, probability of remaining asymptomatic, and the mean lengths of time spent in the exposed and infectious disease states) and examine the resulting impacts on various metrics of epidemic severity, including the effective reproduction number. We then consider the effects of a more complex network model. Results: We find that the mean length of time spent in the infectious state and the transmission rate are the most important model parameters, while the mean length of time spent in the exposed state and the probability of remaining asymptomatic are less important. We also find that the network structure has a significant impact on the dynamics of the disease spread. Conclusions: In this article, we present a modification to the network-based stochastic SEIR epidemic model which allows for modifications to the underlying contact network to account for the effects of quarantine. We also discuss the changes needed to the model to incorporate situations where some proportion of the individuals who are infected remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the disease.",

Based on the proposed deterministic predictor, a stochastic predictor that considers the distribution law of historical data at different locations is further proposed for SMPC.
