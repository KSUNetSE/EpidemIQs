Both states are assumed to possess different waiting time distributions. The rest state is treated as an activation process with an exponentially distributed life time, whereas the latter in the excited state shall have a constant mean which may originate from any distribution. The activation rate of any single unit is determined by its neighbors according to a random complex network structure. In order to treat this problem in an analytical way, we use a heterogeneous mean-field approximation yielding a set of equations generally valid for uncorrelated random networks. Based on this derivation we focus on random binary networks where the network is solely comprised of nodes with either of two degrees. The ratio between the two degrees is shown to be a crucial parameter. Dependent on the composition of the network the steady states show the usual transition from disorder to homogeneously ordered bistability as well as new scenarios that include inhomogeneous ordered and disordered bistability as well as tristability. The various steady states differ in their spiking activity expressed by a state dependent spiking rate. Numerical simulations agree with analytic results of the heterogeneous mean-field approximation.\n",

                    "abstract": "BackgroundConfirmed H1N1 cases during late spring and summer 2009 in various countries showed a substantial age shift between importations and local transmission cases, with adults mainly responsible for seeding unaffected regions and children most frequently driving community outbreaks.MethodsWe introduce a multi-host stochastic metapopulation model with two age classes to analytically investigate the role of a heterogeneously mixing population and its associated non-homogeneous travel behaviors on the risk of a major epidemic. We inform the model with demographic data, contact data and travel statistics of Europe and Mexico, and calibrate it to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic early outbreak. We allow for variations of the model parameters to explore the conditions of invasion under different scenarios.ResultsWe derive the expression for the potential of global invasion of the epidemic that depends on the transmissibility of the pathogen, the transportation network and mobility features, the demographic profile and the mixing pattern. Higher assortativity in the contact pattern greatly increases the probability of spatial containment of the epidemic, this effect being contrasted by an increase in the social activity of adults vs. children. Heterogeneous features of the mobility network characterizing its topology and traffic flows strongly favor the invasion of the pathogen at the spatial level, as also a larger fraction of children traveling. Variations in the demographic profile and mixing habits across countries lead to heterogeneous outbreak situations. Model results are compatible with the H1N1 spatial transmission dynamics observed.ConclusionsThis work illustrates the importance of considering age-dependent mixing profiles and mobility features coupled together to study the conditions for the spatial invasion of an emerging influenza pandemic. Its results allow the immediate assessment of the risk of a major epidemic for a specific scenario upon availability of data, and the evaluation of the potential effectiveness of public health interventions targeting specific age groups, their interactions and mobility behaviors. The approach provides a general modeling framework that can be used for other types of partitions of the host population and applied to different settings.",

We use and adapt an improved effective degree compartmental modeling framework recently proposed by Lindquist et al. [J. Math Biol. 62, 143 (2010)] and Marceau et al. [Phys. Rev. E 82, 036116 (2010)]. The resulting set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is solved numerically, and results are compared to those obtained using individual-based stochastic network simulation. We show that the ODEs display excellent agreement with simulation for the evolution of both the disease and the network and are able to accurately capture the epidemic threshold for a wide range of parameters. We also present an analytical R0 calculation for the dynamic network model and show that, depending on the relative time scales of the network evolution and disease transmission, two limiting cases are recovered: (i) the static network case when network evolution is slow and (ii) homogeneous random mixing when the network evolution is rapid. We also use our threshold calculation to highlight the dangers of relying on local stability analysis when predicting epidemic outbreaks on evolving networks.",
