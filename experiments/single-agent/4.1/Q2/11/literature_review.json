                    "abstract": "The summary measurement of an epidemic such as the final size is an important quantity that allows us to approximate the impact of the disease on the affected region. In recent years, final size measurements for vector-transmitted diseases have acquired importance because of the increased concern for mosquito-borne diseases like dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, etc. However, analytical expressions for this estimate in the stage-structured models applicable to vector-borne diseases are less, mostly focused on the classical Kermack\u2013McKendrick model. In this paper, we first calculate the final size expressions for an SIR model with carrier state and a SEIR\u2013SI host\u2013vector model. Then we extend this for the SEIR\u2013SI host\u2013vector model with treatment class in the host, as well as for the model with vertical transmission in the vector population. Finally, we verify our final size expression with some real scenarios.",

Their inducing epidemics last longer, have a higher number of asymptomatic cases, and are more serious. In this article, we proposed a nonautonomous time-delayed susceptible-infected-removed (NATD-SIR) model to predict them in different regions of China. We obtained the maximum and its time of current infected persons, the final size, and the end time of COVID-19 epidemics from January 2022 in China. The method of the fifth-order moving average was used to preprocess the time series of the numbers of current infected and removed cases to obtain more accurate parameter estimations. We found that usually the transmission rate $ \\beta(t) $ was a piecewise exponential decay function, but due to multiple bounces in Shanghai City, $ \\beta(t) $ was approximately a piecewise quadratic function. In most regions, the removed rate $ \\gamma(t) $ was approximately equal to a piecewise linear increasing function of (a*t+b)*H(t-k), but in a few areas, $ \\gamma(t) $ displayed an exponential increasing trend. For cases where the removed rate cannot be obtained, we proposed a method for setting the removed rate, which has a good approximation. Using the numerical solution, we obtained the prediction results of the epidemics. By analyzing those important indicators of COVID-19, we provided valuable suggestions for epidemic prevention and control and the resumption of work and production.",

                    "abstract": "Background Facing a global epidemic of new infectious diseases such as COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), which reduce transmission rates without medical actions, are being implemented around the world to mitigate spreads. One of the problems in assessing the effects of NPIs is that different NPIs have been implemented at different times based on the situation of each country; therefore, few assumptions can be shared about how the introduction of policies affects the patient population. Mathematical models can contribute to further understanding these phenomena by obtaining analytical solutions as well as numerical simulations. Methods and results In this study, an NPI was introduced into the SIR model for a conceptual study of infectious diseases under the condition that the transmission rate was reduced to a fixed value only once within a finite time duration, and its effect was analyzed numerically and theoretically. It was analytically shown that the maximum fraction of infected individuals and the final size could be larger if the intervention starts too early. The analytical results also suggested that more individuals may be infected at the peak of the second wave with a stronger intervention. Conclusions This study provides quantitative relationship between the strength of a one-shot intervention and the reduction in the number of patients with no approximation. This suggests the importance of the strength and time of NPIs, although detailed studies are necessary for the implementation of NPIs in complicated real-world environments as the model used in this study is based on various simplifications.",

                    "abstract": "Simple Summary Predicting the spreading trend of the COVID-19 epidemic is one of the hot topics in the modeling field. In this study, we applied a continuous Markov-chain model to simulate the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. The results of this study indicate that the herd immunity threshold should be significantly higher than 1 \u2212 1/R0. Taking the immunity waning effect into consideration, the model could predict an epidemic resurgence after the herd immunity threshold. Meanwhile, this Markov-chain approach could also forecast the epidemic distribution and predict the epidemic hotspots at different times. It is implied from our model that it is significantly challenging to eradicate SARS-CoV-2 in the short term. The actual epidemic development is consistent with our prediction. In the end, this method displayed great potential as an alternative approach to traditional compartment models. Abstract To address the urgent need to accurately predict the spreading trend of the COVID-19 epidemic, a continuous Markov-chain model was, for the first time, developed in this work to predict the spread of COVID-19 infection. A probability matrix of infection was first developed in this model based upon the contact frequency of individuals within the population, the individual\u2019s characteristics, and other factors that can effectively reflect the epidemic\u2019s temporal and spatial variation characteristics. The Markov-chain model was then extended to incorporate both the mutation effect of COVID-19 and the decaying effect of antibodies. The developed comprehensive Markov-chain model that integrates the aforementioned factors was finally tested by real data to predict the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic. The result shows that our model can effectively avoid the prediction dilemma that may exist with traditional ordinary differential equations model, such as the susceptible\u2013infectious\u2013recovered (SIR) model. Meanwhile, it can forecast the epidemic distribution and predict the epidemic hotspots geographically at different times. It is also demonstrated in our result that the influence of the population\u2019s spatial and geographic distribution in a herd infection event is needed in the model for a better prediction of the epidemic trend. At the same time, our result indicates that no simple derivative relationship exists between the threshold of herd immunity and the virus basic reproduction number R0. The threshold of herd immunity achieved through natural immunity is significantly higher than 1 \u2212 1/R0. These not only explain the theoretical misconceptions of herd immunity thresholds in herd immunity theory but also provide a guidance for predicting the optimal vaccination coverage. In addition, our model can predict the temporal and spatial distribution of infections in different epidemic waves. It is implied from our model that it is challenging to eradicate COVID-19 in the short term for a large population size and a wide spatial distribution. It is predicted that COVID-19 is likely to coexist with humans for a long time and that it will exhibit multipoint epidemic effects at a later stage. The statistical evidence is consistent with our prediction and strongly supports our modeling results.",

All possible pathways of the interaction between cationic species [Cp2ZrMe+] and counteranions, [A\u2212] = [MeB(C6F5)3]\u2212 and [B(C6F5)4]\u2212, were examined during chain initiation, propagation, and termination steps. The calculations reveal an active chain-end mechanism with O-alkyl bond cleavage of the polymerisation. The catalytic performance of the two counteranions is found to be identical, and they influence the initial process through stabilisation of the cationic species via non-covalent interactions (NCI), with the [MeB(C6F5)3]\u2212 anion stabilising the catalyst\u2013monomer complex more effectively than the [B(C6F5)4]\u2212 anion by 24.3 kJ mol\u22121. The first two propagations are likely the rate-determining step, with calculated free-energy barriers of 61.4\u201371.2 and 73.9\u201380.6 kJ mol\u22121 with and without the anions (A\u2212), respectively. The presence of the counteranion significantly affects the third propagation rate, lowering the barriers up to 20 kJ mol\u22121. Comparison of the first termination and the third propagation shows that they are not competitive, with the termination being less facile. We also studied the initiation and propagation steps for the hafnocene catalyst and found that the Hf catalyst slightly favours the CL CROP in comparison to the Zr catalyst. Analysis of solvent and dispersion interaction demonstrates that both factors play an important role in the process. NCI analysis reveals weak (van der Waals) interactions at the contacts between the cationic species and the counteranions during the reaction course.

The molecular structures of Fe2 and Fe3 were determined by X-ray diffraction, revealing a pseudo-square-pyramidal geometry. High activities were achieved toward ethylene polymerization in each iron complex case. The sterically least demanding ligand enhanced the activity of its complex Fe1 with the highest activity up to 16.8 \u00d7 106 g of PE (mol of Fe)-1 h-1at 70 \u00b0C, while the bulkiest ligand led to the formation of the highest molecular weight of the resulting polyethylene using Fe6. Generally, the resulting polyethylenes are highly linear and most of them have a tendency to display bimodal distributions by virtue of the presence of multiple sites or competing chain transfer reactions.

A\u03b240 and A\u03b242, as two most prominent isoforms of A\u03b2 peptides, can cross-interact with each other and form co-aggregates, which affect the progression of the disease. However, the molecular determinants underlying A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 cross-interaction and the structural details of their co-oligomers remain elusive. Herein, we performed all-atom explicit-solvent replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations on A\u03b240-A\u03b242 heterogeneous and A\u03b240/A\u03b242 homogeneous dimer systems to dissect the co-aggregation mechanisms of the two isoforms. Our results show that the interpeptide main-chain interaction of A\u03b240-A\u03b242 is stronger than that of A\u03b240-A\u03b240 and A\u03b242-A\u03b242. The positions of hotspot residues in heterodimers and homodimers display high similarity, implying similar molecular recognition sites for both cross-interaction and self-interaction. Contact maps of A\u03b240-A\u03b242 heterodimers reveal that residue pairs crucial for cross-interaction are mostly located in the C-terminal hydrophobic regions of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 peptides. Conformational analysis shows that A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 monomers can co-assemble into \u03b2-sheet-rich heterodimers with shorter \u03b2-sheets than those in homodimers, which is decremental to monomer addition. Similar molecular recognition sites and \u03b2-sheet distribution of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 peptides are observed in heterodimers and homodimers, which may provide the molecular basis for the two isoforms' co-aggregation and cross-seeding. Our work dissects the co-aggregation mechanisms of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 peptides at the atomic level, which will help for in-depth understanding of the cross-talk between the two A\u03b2 isoforms and the pathogenesis of AD.",

In this mini-review, the recent discovery of two unprecedented chain termination processes is summarized: chain transfer to solvent (CTS) and chain transfer to monomer (CTM), leading to benzyl/tolyl and allyl type chain ends, respectively. Although similar transfer reactions are well-known in radical polymerization, only very recently they have been observed also in olefin insertion polymerization catalysis. In the latter context, these processes were first identified in Ti-catalyzed propene and ethene polymerization; more recently, CTS was also reported in Sc-catalyzed styrene polymerization. In the Ti case, these processes represent a unique combination of insertion polymerization, organic radical chemistry and reactivity of a M(IV)/M(III) redox couple. In the Sc case, CTS occurs via a \u03c3-bond metathesis reactivity, and it is associated with a significant boost of catalytic activity and/or with tuning of polystyrene molecular weight and tacticity. The mechanistic studies that led to the understanding of these chain transfer reactions are summarized, highlighting their relevance in olefin polymerization catalysis and beyond.",

The molecular mechanisms of the formation of toxic species are still elusive. Some peptides and proteins can form functional amyloid-like aggregates mainly in bacteria and fungi but also in humans. Little is known on the differences in self-assembly mechanisms of functional and pathogenic (poly)peptides. We review atomistic and coarse-grained simulation studies of amyloid peptides in their monomeric, oligomeric, and fibrillar states. Particular emphasis is given to the challenges one faces to characterize at atomic level of detail the conformational space of disordered (poly)peptides and their aggregation. We discuss the difficulties in comparing simulation results and experimental data, and we propose new simulation studies to shed light on the aggregation processes associated with amyloid diseases.",
