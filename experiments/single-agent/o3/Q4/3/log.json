Mean--field analysis provides survival, winning, and coexistence conditions in terms of the effective infection ratios $\\tau _1=\\beta _1/\\delta _1$ and $\\tau _2=\\beta _2/\\delta _2$ and the spectral radii $\\lambda_1(A)$ and $\\lambda_1(B)$ of the adjacency matrices of layers~A and~B.  Stochastic simulations on synthetic Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi and Barab\\'asi--Albert layers substantiate the theory.  Despite both $\\tau_1>1/\\lambda_1(A)$ and $\\tau_2>1/\\lambda_1(B)$, dominance rather than coexistence emerged when the leading eigenvectors of the layers overlapped substantially or when transmission advantages were unequal.  A permutation experiment reducing central--node overlap confirms that structural disassortativity across layers is a necessary, although not sufficient, condition for coexistence.  The analytical and numerical insights contribute to understanding competitive contagion and designing infrastructures that foster or suppress coexistence of digital content.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{IEEEkeywords}\nMultiplex networks, Competitive SIS model, Exclusive memes, Coexistence, Spectral analysis, FastGEMF simulation.\n\\end{IEEEkeywords}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe simultaneous diffusion of multiple, mutually exclusive contagions---ranging from biological strains to viral information memes---is ubiquitous in social and technological networks.  When each contagion follows susceptible--infected--susceptible (SIS) rules and competes for the same hosts, a central question is whether both strains can persist (\n\\emph{coexistence}) or whether one invariably eradicates the other (\n\\emph{absolute dominance}).  Prior single--layer analyses concluded that identical transmission routes preclude coexistence because the strain with the larger basic reproduction number eventually eliminates the weaker \\cite{Chakrabarti08}.  However, real systems often entail multiple, partially overlapping layers of interaction.  Pioneering work by Sahneh \\emph{et~al.} proved that a region of coexistence opens up if the dominant eigenvectors of the layers are sufficiently distinct \\cite{CompetingSpreading14}.  The present study revisits that theory, articulates precise spectral conditions, and confronts them with agent--based simulations using the FastGEMF framework.\n\nOur contribution is twofold.  First, we provide a compact mean--field derivation of survival and winning thresholds for an \\emph{SI$_1$SI$_2$S} model where infection by one meme immunizes against the other.  We explicate how overlap of eigenvector centralities modulates the nonlinear fixed points.  Second, we instantiate the model on an Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi (ER) layer~A and a Barab\\'asi--Albert (BA) layer~B that share nodes.  Two scenarios are contrasted: (i) layers aligned such that hubs coincide and (ii) a permuted BA layer that disrupts central--node alignment.  Simulation results confirm analytic predictions: coexistence fails in both scenarios because the infection advantage $\\tau_1>\\tau_2$ outweighs structural orthogonality; yet the weaker meme attains a higher transient peak when hubs are unaligned, illustrating the mitigating role of multiplex structure.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Mechanistic Model}\nWe extend the competitive \\textit{SI$_1$SI$_2$S} model of \\cite{CompetingSpreading14}.  Each node $i$ can reside in state $S, I_1,$ or $I_2$.  Transitions occur as\n\\begin{align*}\nS + I_1 &\\xrightarrow{\\beta_1} I_1,\\qquad I_1 \\xrightarrow{\\delta_1} S, \\\\\nS + I_2 &\\xrightarrow{\\beta_2} I_2,\\qquad I_2 \\xrightarrow{\\delta_2} S.\n\\end{align*}\nEdges of layer~A mediate the $I_1$--driven infection while edges of layer~B mediate the $I_2$--driven infection.  Mutual exclusion forbids simultaneous infection.\n\n\\subsection{Mean--Field Analysis}\nLet $x_{1i}(t)$ and $x_{2i}(t)$ be the probabilities that node $i$ is in states $I_1$ and~$I_2$ at time~$t$.  Define $s_i=1-x_{1i}-x_{2i}$.  Linearizing around the disease--free equilibrium yields\n\\begin{align}\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}_1 &= (\\beta_1 A-\\delta_1 I)\\mathbf{x}_1,\\quad\n\\dot{\\mathbf{x}}_2 = (\\beta_2 B-\\delta_2 I)\\mathbf{x}_2.\n\\end{align}\nHence meme~$k$ can survive individually if $\\tau_k\\lambda_1(\\text{layer }k)>1$.  When both inequalities hold, nonlinear coupling determines long--term outcomes.  Following \\cite{CompetingSpreading14}, define $\\mathbf{v}_A$ and $\\mathbf{v}_B$ as normalized principal eigenvectors.  The coexistence fixed point exists only if\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:coex}\n(\\tau_1-\\tau_1^{*})(\\tau_2-\\tau_2^{*})>\\rho^2,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\rho=\\mathbf{v}_A^{\\top}\\mathbf{v}_B\\in[0,1]$ measures eigenvector overlap and $\\tau_k^{*}=1/\\lambda_1(\\text{layer }k)$ are basic thresholds.  Equation~(\\ref{eq:coex}) reveals that perfect overlap ($\\rho=1$) annihilates the coexistence region, while orthogonal layers ($\\rho\\approx0$) allow coexistence provided neither meme enjoys a large advantage in~$\\tau$.\n\n\\subsection{Network Construction}\nLayer~A is an ER graph with $N=1000$ nodes and link probability $p=0.01$ ($\\langle k\\rangle=9.97$).  Layer~B is a BA graph with $m=3$ yielding $\\langle k\\rangle=5.98$.  Spectral radii were computed numerically as $\\lambda_1(A)=10.99$ and $\\lambda_1(B)=12.93$.  The leading eigenvectors show cosine overlap $\\rho=0.83$ when node labels coincide.  To create a low--overlap variant, we randomly permuted node labels of the BA layer resulting in $\\rho\\approx0.06$.\n\n\\subsection{Parameter Selection and Simulation Setup}\nGiven $\\lambda_1$, we set $\\delta_1=\\delta_2=1$ without loss of generality and choose $\\beta_1=0.15$ ($\\tau_1=0.15$) and $\\beta_2=0.12$ ($\\tau_2=0.12$).  Both exceed their respective thresholds $1/\\lambda_1$ (0.091 and 0.077), satisfying the ``above--threshold'' premise.  Initial conditions infect $5\\%$ of nodes with each meme at random.  FastGEMF executed five stochastic realizations for 300 time steps per scenario, storing average compartment counts.\n\n\\section{Results}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:traj} compares temporal prevalence.  In the aligned--layer scenario (results\\_11.png), meme~1 rapidly dominates: its prevalence peaks at $39.6\\%$ whereas meme~2 peaks at $7.8\\%$ before extinction.  Final infected fractions are $30.2\\%$ and $0\\%$, respectively (Table~\\ref{tab:metrics}).  In the permuted scenario (results\\_12.png) transient prevalence of meme~2 increases to $5.3\\%$ but still vanishes; meme~1 metrics remain virtually unchanged.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{results-11.png}\\\\\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{results-12.png}\n\\caption{Prevalence trajectories for aligned (top) and permuted (bottom) multiplex layers.

Our numerical experiment manipulated the second factor while keeping infection ratios unequal ($\\tau_1>\\tau_2$).  As anticipated, coexistence was not observed even when $\\rho\\approx0.06$.  Meme~2 nevertheless achieved higher transient prevalence when structural overlap was removed, supporting the view that multiplex heterogeneity delays but does not prevent dominance in the presence of a strong transmission advantage.\n\nThese findings emphasize that network design aiming for sustained pluralism must balance both spectral and dynamical parameters.  Equalizing $\\tau$ values through content moderation or vaccination analogues appears indispensable.  Future work should explore adaptive responses, temporal networks, and more than two competing strains.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nWe presented a joint analytic--simulation study of mutually exclusive SIS processes on multiplex networks.  Mean--field theory articulated coexistence boundaries governed by infection ratios and eigenvector overlap.  FastGEMF simulations on synthetic ER--BA layers confirmed that exceeding single--layer thresholds is insufficient for coexistence; spectral similarity and parameter disparity foster dominance.  The framework and insights inform the control of competing contagions in online and epidemiological settings.\n\n\\section*{References}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{1}\n\\bibitem{Chakrabarti08} D.~Chakrabarti, Y.~Wang, C.~Wang, J.~Leskovec and C.~Faloutsos, ``Epidemic thresholds in real networks: an eigenvalue viewpoint,'' \\emph{ACM Transactions on Information and System Security}, vol.~10, no.~4, pp.~1--26, 2008.\n\n\\bibitem{CompetingSpreading14} F.~D.
