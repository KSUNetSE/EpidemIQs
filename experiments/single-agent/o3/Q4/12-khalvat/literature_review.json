This peculiar connectivity provides an ideal environment for the spreading of infective agents. Here we show that the random uniform immunization of individuals does not lead to the eradication of infections in all complex networks. Namely, networks with scale-free properties do not acquire global immunity from major epidemic outbreaks even in the presence of unrealistically high densities of randomly immunized individuals. The absence of any critical immunization threshold is due to the unbounded connectivity fluctuations of scale-free networks. Successful immunization strategies can be developed only by taking into account the inhomogeneous connectivity properties of scale-free networks. In particular, targeted immunization schemes, based on the nodes' connectivity hierarchy, sharply lower the network's vulnerability to epidemic attacks.",

Specifically, the paper deals with three competing virus systems (i.e., tri-virus systems). First, we show that a tri-virus system, unlike a bi-virus system, is not a monotone dynamical system. Using the Parametric Transversality Theorem, we show that, generically, a tri-virus system has a finite number of equilibria and that the Jacobian matrices associated with each equilibrium are nonsingular. The endemic equilibria of this system can be classified as follows: a) single-virus endemic equilibria (also referred to as the boundary equilibria), where precisely one of the three viruses is alive; b) 2-coexistence equilibria, where exactly two of the three viruses are alive; and c) 3-coexistence equilibria, where all three viruses survive in the network. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition that guarantees local exponential convergence to a boundary equilibrium. Further, we secure conditions for the nonexistence of 3-coexistence equilibria (resp. for various forms of 2-coexistence equilibria). We also identify sufficient conditions for the existence of a 2-coexistence (resp. 3-coexistence) equilibrium. We identify conditions on the model parameters that give rise to a continuum of coexistence equilibria. More specifically, we establish i) a scenario that admits the existence and local exponential attractivity of a line of coexistence equilibria; and ii) scenarios that admit the existence of, and, in the case of one such scenario, global convergence to, a plane of 3-coexistence equilibria.",

Since the system is also monotone, it turns out that the typical behavior of the system is convergence to some equilibrium point.

                    "abstract": "The study of spreading processes on complex networks has gained significant attention recently. For example, bond percolation models considering population heterogeneity have been used to provide insights into disease spread and misinformation control. However, most of these studies focus on single-layer contact networks. In our work, we examine how the spreading process is impacted by the existence of multiple contact network layers, considering layer-dependent population heterogeneity from a principled, mathematical perspective. Using SIR dynamics, we derive expressions for three key epidemiological measures: the probability of emergence, the epidemic threshold, and the expected epidemic size. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our analytical results match the numerical results near-perfectly in the finite node regime. These findings reveal the interplay among the multi-layer network structures, transmission dynamics, and population heterogeneity in determining the final outcome of the spreading process. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of layer-dependent population heterogeneity and identify important factors for developing effective and economical layer-oriented spreading control strategies. Overall, our work provides insights into developing and analyzing mitigation and control strategies for disease spread and information diffusion across multi-layer complex networks.",

                    "abstract": "Preparedness for any future epidemic has become an urgent need. Epidemic modeling and simulation are at the core of the healthcare efforts that are underway to assert some level of control over the spreading and the treatment of a pathogen. In this milieu, this paper describes a stochastic dynamic model to simulate the spreading of infectious diseases. We present the equations that describe the system dynamics, their adjoint systems, and their optimal control characterization by means of the discrete-system extension of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. This derivation is presented in two different cases: a vaccination policy and a combined vaccination-treatment approach. We show the behavior of such models via numerical simulations using the forward-backward sweep procedure. While somewhat speculative, this paper provides insights into how to evaluate different theoretical optimal healthcare policies during an epidemic, either at the individual or metapopulation resolution level.",
