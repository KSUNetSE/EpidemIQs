                    "abstract": "Background. The COVID-19 pandemic is of great interest to researchers due to high mortality and a very negative impact to the world economy. A detailed scientific analysis of the phenomenon is yet to come, but the public is already interested in the problems of duration of the epidemic, the expected number of patients, where and when the pandemic started. Correct simulation of the pandemic dynamics needs complicated mathematical models and many efforts for unknown parameters identification. In this article, preliminary estimates for many countries and world will be presented, summarized and discussed. Objective. We will estimate the epidemic characteristics for USA, Germany, UK, the Republic of Korea and in the world with the use of SIR simulations and compare them with the results obtained before for Italy, Spain, France, the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and Kyiv. The hidden periods, epidemic durations, final numbers of cases and quarantine measures will be discussed. Methods. In this study we use the known SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model for the dynamics of the epidemic, the known exact solution of the linear differential equations and statistical approach developed before. Results. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified with the use of statistical approach for epidemic dynamics in USA, Germany, UK, the Republic of Korea, and in the world. The actual number of cases and the number of patients spreading the infection versus time were calculated. The hidden periods, durations and final sizes of the epidemic were evaluated. In particular, the pandemic began in China no later than October, 2019. If current trends continue, the end of the pandemic should be expected no earlier than March 2021, the global number of cases will exceed 5 million. A simple method for assessing the risk of premature weakening of quarantines is proposed. Conclusions. The SIR model and statistical approach to the parameter identification are helpful to make some reliable estimations for the epidemic dynamics, e.g., the real time of the outbreak, final size and duration of the epidemic and the number of persons spreading the infection versus time. This information will be useful to regulate the quarantine activities and to predict the medical and economic consequences of the pandemic.",

Many \u2018structured models\u2019 capture aspects of the contact pattern through an underlying network or a mixing matrix. An important observation in unstructured models of a disease that confers immunity is that once a fraction 1-1/R0\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$1-1/{\\mathcal {R}}_0$$\\end{document} has been infected, the residual susceptible population can no longer sustain an epidemic. A recent observation of some structured models is that this threshold can be crossed with a smaller fraction of infected individuals, because the disease acts like a targeted vaccine, preferentially immunising higher-risk individuals who play a greater role in transmission. Therefore, a limited \u2018first wave\u2019 may leave behind a residual population that cannot support a second wave once interventions are lifted. In this paper, we set out to investigate this more systematically. While networks offer a flexible framework to model contact patterns explicitly, they suffer from several shortcomings: (i) high-fidelity network models require a large amount of data which can be difficult to harvest, and (ii) very few, if any, theoretical contact network models offer the flexibility to tune different contact network properties within the same framework. Therefore, we opt to systematically analyse a number of well-known mean-field models. These are computationally efficient and provide good flexibility in varying contact network properties such as heterogeneity in the number contacts, clustering and household structure or differentiating between local and global contacts. In particular, we consider the question of herd immunity under several scenarios. When modelling interventions as changes in transmission rates, we confirm that in networks with significant degree heterogeneity, the first wave of the epidemic confers herd immunity with significantly fewer infections than equivalent models with less or no degree heterogeneity. However, if modelling the intervention as a change in the contact network, then this effect may become much more subtle. Indeed, modifying the structure disproportionately can shield highly connected nodes from becoming infected during the first wave and therefore make the second wave more substantial. We strengthen this finding by using an age-structured compartmental model parameterised with real data and comparing lockdown periods implemented either as a global scaling of the mixing matrix or age-specific structural changes. Overall, we find that results regarding (disease-induced) herd immunity levels are strongly dependent on the model, the duration of the lockdown and how the lockdown is implemented in the model.",

                    "abstract": "The spread of SARS-CoV-2 through direct transmission (person-to-person) has been the focus of most studies on the dynamics of COVID-19. The efficacy of social distancing and mask usage at reducing the risk of direct transmission of COVID-19 has been studied by many researchers. Little or no attention is given to indirect transmission of the virus through shared items, commonly touch surfaces and door handles. The impact of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and in the environment, on the dynamics of COVID-19 remain largely unknown. Also, the current increase in the number of cases despite the strict non-pharmaceutical interventions suggests a need to study the indirect transmission of COVID-19 while incorporating testing of infected individuals as a preventive measure. Assessing the impact of indirect transmission of the virus may improve our understanding of the overall dynamics of COVID-19. We developed a novel deterministic susceptible-exposedinfected- removed-virus-death compartmental model to study the impact of indirect transmission pathway on the spread of COVID-19, the sources of infection, and prevention/control. We fitted the model to the cumulative number of confirmed cases at episode date in Toronto, Canada using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization algorithm. We studied the effect of indirect transmission on the epidemic peak, peak time, epidemic final size and the effective reproduction number, based on different initial conditions and at different stages. Our findings revealed an increase in cases with indirect transmission. Our work highlights the importance of implementing additional preventive and control measures involving cleaning of surfaces, fumigation, and disinfection to lower the spread of COVID-19, especially in public areas like the grocery stores, malls and so on. We conclude that indirect transmission of SARS-CoV- 2 has a significant effect on the dynamics of COVID-19, and there is need to consider this transmission route for effective mitigation, prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic.",

Cooke (1967) that infected individuals become infective if they are exposed often enough for a natural disease resistance to be overcome is built into a Kermack-McKendrick type epidemic model with infectivity age. Both the case that the resistance may be the same for all hosts and the case that it is distributed among the host population are considered. In addition to the familiar threshold behavior of the final size of the epidemic with respect to a basic reproductive number, an Allee effect is generated with respect to the final cumulative force of infection exerted by the initial infectives. This offers a deterministic explanation of why geographic areas that appear to be epidemiologically similar have epidemic outbreaks of quite different severity.",

We demonstrate the veracity of the KMES using the Google Residential Mobility Measure to accurately project case data from the Covid 19 pandemic and we derive many useful, but previously unknown, analytical expressions for characterizing and managing an epidemic. These include expressions for the viral load, the final size, the effective reproduction number, and the time to the peak in infections. The KMES can also be cast in the form of a step function system response to the input of new infections; and that response is the time series of total infections. Since the publication of Kermack and McKendricks seminal paper (1927), thousands of authors have utilized the Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered (SIR) approximations; expressions putatively derived from the integro-differential equations to model epidemic dynamics. Implicit in the use of the SIR approximation are the beliefs that there is no closed form solution to the integro-differential equations, and that the approximation is a special case which adequately reproduces the dynamics of the integro-differential equations mapped onto the physical world. However, the KMES demonstrates that the SIR approximations are not adequate representations of the integro-differential equations, and we therefore suggest that the KMES obsoletes the need for the SIR approximations by providing not only a new mathematical perspective, but a new understanding of epidemic dynamics.",

The discrete time version is as general and flexible as its continuous-time counterpart, and contains numerous compartmental models as special cases. In contrast to the continuous time version, the discrete time version of the model is very easy to implement computationally, and thus promises to become a powerful tool for exploring control scenarios for specific infectious diseases. To demonstrate the potential, we investigate numerically how the incidence-peak size depends on model ingredients. We find that, with the same reproduction number and initial speed of epidemic spread, compartmental models systematically predict lower peak sizes than models that use a fixed duration for the latent and infectious periods.",

The first relation is 1/\u03c4grow=1/\u03c4trans\u22121/\u03c4inf, where \u03c4grow is the time constant of the exponential growth of an epidemic, \u03c4trans is the time for a pathogen to be transmitted from one patient to uninfected person, and the infectious time \u03c4inf is the time during which the pathogen keeps its power of transmission. The second relation p(\u221e) \u22481\u2212exp(\u2212(R0\u22121)/0.60) is the relation between p(\u221e), the final size of the disaster defined by the ratio of the total infected people to the population of the society,and the basic reproduction number, R0, which is the number of persons infected by the transmission of the pathogen from one infected person during the infectious time. The third relation 1/\u03c4end=1/\u03c4inf\u2212(1\u2212p(\u221e))/\u03c4trans gives the decay time constant \u03c4end at the ending stage of the epidemic.
