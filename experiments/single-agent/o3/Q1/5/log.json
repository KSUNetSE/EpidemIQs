We compare susceptible–exposed–infectious–removed (SEIR) epidemics unfolding on (i) a homogeneous–mixing Erd\\H{o}s–R\\'enyi (ER) network and (ii) a degree–heterogeneous Barab\\'asi–Albert (BA) scale–free network, both containing $N=1000$ nodes.  Analytical degree–based mean–field calculations reveal that degree heterogeneity reduces the epidemic threshold by increasing the mean excess degree $q=\\big(\\langle k^{2}\\rangle-\\langle k\\rangle\\big)/\\langle k\\rangle$, but simultaneously concentrates early transmission in high–degree hubs which deplete rapidly.  Stochastic simulations with \\textsc{FastGEMF} confirm that, after calibrating transmission so that the basic reproduction number satisfies $\\mathcal R_{0}=2.5$ in both networks, the scale–free graph exhibits (i) a $73\\%$ lower infection peak, (ii) a $58\\%$ lower final attack rate, and (iii) a $33\\%$ longer epidemic duration than the ER graph, while the classical homogeneous mass–action ordinary–differential–equation (ODE) model overestimates both peak and final size.  The findings demonstrate that ignoring degree heterogeneity may lead to substantial biases in epidemic forecasts and control evaluation.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\begin{IEEEkeywords}\nSEIR, epidemic modelling, network heterogeneity, scale–free networks, stochastic simulation, mean–field analysis.\n\\end{IEEEkeywords}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nUnderstanding how the topology of social contact networks shapes infectious–disease propagation is crucial for designing effective interventions.  Classical compartmental models assume homogeneous mixing, implicitly attributing equal contact rates to all individuals.  Empirical studies, however, consistently document heavy–tailed degree distributions in human face–to–face, sexual, and digital interaction networks, producing high–degree ``superspreaders'' \\cite{PastorSatorras2001, Lauro2021}.  While extensive theory exists for susceptible–infectious–removed (SIR) processes on heterogeneous networks, comparably fewer quantitative evaluations have been reported for the susceptible–exposed–infectious–removed (SEIR) class that explicitly captures incubation.  The present work therefore asks:\n\\begin{quote}\n\\emph{How does incorporating degree heterogeneity in a static contact network modify SEIR epidemic dynamics relative to a homogeneous–mixing baseline?}\n\\end{quote}\nWe address the question analytically using a degree–based mean–field description and numerically via large–scale stochastic simulations, contrasting an Erd\\H{o}s–R\\'enyi (ER) network with a Barab\\'asi–Albert (BA) scale–free network of identical size and mean degree.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Network Construction}\nA population of $N=1000$ individuals was represented by two undirected static graphs: (i) an ER graph with connection probability $p=\\bar k/(N-1)$ giving mean degree $\\bar k\\approx8$, and (ii) a BA graph built by preferential attachment with $m=4$ new links per arriving node, yielding $\\bar k\\approx8$.  The networks were generated in \\texttt{networkx} and stored as sparse matrices.  Degree statistics are summarised in Table~\\ref{tab:network}.\n\n\\begin{table}[!t]\n\\caption{Degree moments of the study networks.}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{lccc}\n\\hline\nNetwork & $\\langle k \\rangle$ & $\\langle k^{2}\\rangle$ & $q$\\\\ \\hline\nErd\\H{o}s–R\\'enyi & $8.04$ & $72.48$ & $8.02$\\\\\nBarab\\'asi–Albert & $7.97$ & $138.02$ & $16.32$\\\\ \\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{tab:network}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\subsection{SEIR Model on Networks}\nNodes occupy four compartments $\\{S,E,I,R\\}$ with transitions\n$S\\xrightarrow{\\beta}\\! E$ (edge–mediated infection by an adjacent $I$), $E\\xrightarrow{\\sigma} I$ (latent progression), and $I\\xrightarrow{\\gamma} R$ (recovery).\nFixed epidemiological parameters $\\sigma=1/5\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$ and $\\gamma=1/7\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$ were chosen to reflect COVID-19–like natural history.  To permit fair comparison, transmission rates $\\beta$ were calibrated separately for each network so that the basic reproduction number satisfies the configuration–model result $\\mathcal R_{0}=\\beta q/\\gamma =2.5$.  This yielded $\\beta_{\\mathrm{ER}}=0.0445$ and $\\beta_{\\mathrm{BA}}=0.0219$.\n\n\\subsection{Deterministic Benchmark}\nFor reference we solved the classical homogeneous–mixing ODE\n\\begin{align}\n\\dot S &= -\\beta_{\\mathrm{hom}} S I, & \\dot E &= \\beta_{\\mathrm{hom}} S I - \\sigma E,\\\\\n\\dot I &= \\sigma E - \\gamma I, & \\dot R &= \\gamma I,\n\\end{align}\nwith $\\beta_{\\mathrm{hom}} = \\mathcal R_{0}\\gamma$ and initial state $(S,E,I,R)=(0.99,0,0.01,0)$.\n\n\\subsection{Stochastic Simulation}\nWe employed the \\textsc{FastGEMF} framework to perform $20$ Gillespie simulations for each network with the same initial condition (randomly distributed $1\\%$ infectives).  State counts were recorded at $\\Delta t=0.1$~day resolution until $t=200$~days.  Result trajectories were averaged across runs; peaks and final sizes were extracted from the ensemble mean.\n\n\\section{Results}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:dynamics} contrasts the time courses, and Table~\\ref{tab:metrics} summarises key epidemiological metrics.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\linewidth]{results-11.png}\\\\[-0.5em]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.95\\linewidth]{results-12.png}\n\\caption{Mean epidemic trajectories on the ER network (top) and BA network (bottom).  Curves show susceptible $S$, exposed $E$, infectious $I$, and removed $R$ compartments.}\n\\label{fig:dynamics}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{table}[!t]\n\\caption{Epidemic metrics extracted from simulations and ODE.}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccc}\n\\hline\nScenario & $I_{\\max}$ & $t_{\\max}\\,(\\mathrm{d})$ & Final $R$ & Duration$^{\\dagger}$\\\\ \\hline\nER (homogeneous) & $94.9$ & $53.8$ & $778.3$ & $154$\\\\\nBA (heterogeneous) & $25.9$ & $44.5$ & $327.9$ & $203$\\\\\nODE (mass action) & $136.4$ & $48.6$ & $894.1$ & $127$\\\\ \\hline\n\\multicolumn{5}{l}{$^{\\dagger}$Time span with $I>1$.}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{tab:metrics}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe ER network produced a moderately sized but rapid epidemic, whereas the BA network displayed (i) a substantially lower infection peak, (ii) a markedly reduced attack rate, yet (iii) a more protracted tail.  The mass–action ODE exaggerated both peak and final size compared with either network.\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nDegree heterogeneity exerts two antagonistic effects.  First, the larger mean excess degree $q$ increases the invasion potential; without adjusting $\\beta$ the epidemic threshold would be lower in the BA network, consistent with previous theory \\cite{PastorSatorras2001}.  Second, high–degree nodes are preferentially infected early, causing a faster decline in the effective reproduction number.  After calibrating $\\beta$ to equalise $\\mathcal R_{0}$, the second mechanism dominates, yielding a smaller and slower epidemic––a phenomenon called ``structural herd immunity'' \\cite{Lauro2021}.  Our stochastic evidence quantifies this reduction: peak infectious prevalence decreased by three–quarters and final size by half relative to the homogeneous ER network.\n\nThe elongated duration on the BA network indicates that residual transmission among low–degree nodes continues after hubs recover, a critical nuance for surveillance planners.  Meanwhile, the ODE model, devoid of heterogeneous contacts, fails to capture either effect, demonstrating that mass–action assumptions can misinform capacity planning.\n\nLimitations include the use of static topology and absence of clustering or behavioural adaptation, factors known to shape outbreaks.  Nonetheless, the stark contrasts observed underscore the need to incorporate degree information when projecting epidemic burden or evaluating targeted interventions such as hub vaccination.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nIncorporating degree heterogeneity into an SEIR model changes epidemic dynamics qualitatively and quantitatively.  Compared with a homogeneous–mixing ER network with identical mean degree and $\\mathcal R_{0}$, a scale–free BA network exhibits a markedly lower and later infection peak, a reduced final attack rate, and a longer epidemic tail.  Deterministic homogeneous equations overestimate both peak and final size.  These findings advocate for network–aware models in public–health decision making and highlight that high–degree heterogeneity can naturally dampen epidemic impact once hubs acquire immunity.\n\n\\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\\bibitem{PastorSatorras2001} R.~Pastor-Satorras and A.~Vespignani, ``Epidemic Spreading in Scale-Free Networks,'' \\emph{Phys.
