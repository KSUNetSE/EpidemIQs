We first derive reproduction numbers and early–growth conditions for both cases using deterministic mean–field and degree–based moment closure approaches.  We then build two synthetic static networks—a Poisson–like Erdős–Rényi (ER) graph and a scale–free Barabási–Albert (BA) graph—with matched mean degree but strongly differing degree variance.  Stochastic simulations of a continuous–time SEIR model on these networks are executed with identical biological parameters (latent period three days, infectious period seven days) and a transmission rate calibrated so that the ER network has $\\mathcal R_0=2$.  Analytical expressions predict, and simulations confirm, that the higher second moment of the BA degree distribution amplifies $\\mathcal R_0$ to $\\approx5.3$, producing an epidemic that peaks earlier (30~days vs.~60~days) and higher (674 vs.~450 simultaneous infections) yet terminates sooner.  Our results quantify the bias introduced when degree heterogeneity is ignored and underscore the importance of realistic network structure in epidemic forecasting and control.\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nMathematical epidemic models often invoke homogeneous mixing, whereby every individual contacts every other with equal probability.  Real social networks, however, display wide degree heterogeneity, and recent theoretical work has shown that such heterogeneity can drastically alter thresholds and epidemic final sizes\\cite{Xi2024,Xie2022}.  We examine this effect systematically for an SEIR natural–history model, combining deterministic analysis with large–scale stochastic simulations on synthetic networks whose only difference is the variance of node degree.  The overarching research question is: ``What changes occur in epidemic timing, peak magnitude, and attack rate when degree heterogeneity is incorporated?''\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Network Construction}\nTwo $N=5000$–node static graphs were generated with NetworkX.  The ER graph used linking probability $p=10/(N-1)$, giving mean degree $\\langle k\\rangle_{\\text{ER}}=9.86$ and second moment $\\langle k^{2}\\rangle_{\\text{ER}}=107.2$.  The BA graph attached $m=5$ edges per arriving node, yielding $\\langle k\\rangle_{\\text{BA}}=9.99$ but a much larger $\\langle k^{2}\\rangle_{\\text{BA}}=272.6$.  Sparse adjacency matrices were stored for reproducibility.\n\n\\subsection{Deterministic Analysis}\n\\subsubsection{Homogeneous–Mixing SEIR}\nWith total population $N$, the classical model reads\n\\begin{align}\n\\dot S &= -\\beta S I/N,\\\\\n\\dot E &= \\beta S I/N-\\sigma E,\\\\\n\\dot I &= \\sigma E-\\gamma I,\\\\\n\\dot R &= \\gamma I.\n\\end{align}\nThe basic reproduction number is $\\mathcal R_0^{\\text{HM}}=\\beta/\\gamma$.  Early exponential growth rate $r$ satisfies $(r+\\gamma)(r+\\sigma)=\\beta \\sigma$.  Final size $R_\\infty$ follows the transcendental equation $R_\\infty = N\\bigl(1-e^{-\\mathcal R_0^{\\text{HM}} R_\\infty/N}\\bigr)$.\n\n\\subsubsection{Degree–Heterogeneous Configuration Model}\nExtending the pair–approximation of Pastor–Satorras \\emph{et al.}, the heterogeneous reproduction number becomes\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathcal R_0^{\\text{HET}}=\\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}\\frac{\\langle k^{2}\\rangle-\\langle k\\rangle}{\\langle k\\rangle} \\equiv \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} q,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $q$ is the mean excess degree.  Using network moments computed above, $q_{\\text{ER}}=9.87$ and $q_{\\text{BA}}=26.28$.  Setting $\\mathcal R_0^{\\text{HM}}=2$ fixes $\\beta=2\\gamma/q_{\\text{ER}}=0.0289$.  Under this calibration, $\\mathcal R_0^{\\text{HET}}=5.33$ on the BA graph, predicting faster, larger outbreaks.\n\n\\subsection{Stochastic Simulation}\nWe implemented a continuous–time Markov SEIR process with \\texttt{fastgemf}.  Biological parameters were $\\sigma=1/3$~d$^{-1}$ and $\\gamma=1/7$~d$^{-1}$.  Initial conditions seeded one percent of the population as infectious.  Fifty stochastic replicates up to 160~days were run on each network.  Population trajectories were aggregated and saved (\\texttt{results-21.png}, \\texttt{results-22.png}).\n\n\\section{Results}\nFigure~\\ref{fig-hom} depicts mean epidemic trajectories on the ER graph, while Fig.~\\ref{fig-het} shows those on the BA graph.  Table~\\ref{tab-metrics} summarises key metrics.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{results-21.png}\n  \\caption{Temporal evolution of SEIR compartments on the homogeneous–mixing ER network.}\n  \\label{fig-hom}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{results-22.png}\n  \\caption{Temporal evolution on the degree–heterogeneous BA network.

Stochastic simulations corroborate this theory: the heterogeneous network exhibits a more explosive epidemic with an infectious peak 50\\% larger and reached twice as quickly.  Interestingly, the final attack rate is slightly lower despite the higher peak, because high–degree hubs are removed early, fragmenting residual transmission pathways.  These findings align with bifurcation analyses that emphasise the role of structural heterogeneity in shifting epidemic thresholds\\cite{Xi2024,Xie2022}.\n\nIgnoring degree variance therefore underestimates both the speed and intensity of outbreaks, potentially delaying intervention triggers.  Calibrating $\\beta$ to case data using homogeneous mixing could substantially mis–specify transmission risk once interventions rewire contacts or when the epidemic invades a differently structured community.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nDegree heterogeneity magnifies the basic reproduction number in proportion to the mean excess degree, accelerating and amplifying epidemic waves.  Deterministic formulas derived from network moments accurately predict the qualitative and quantitative changes observed in stochastic simulations.  Consequently, public–health models and real–time forecasts should incorporate contact heterogeneity—or at minimum adjust $\\beta$ by measured network variance—to avoid systematic bias.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgement}\nThe authors thank the open–source \\texttt{fastgemf} community for computational tools.\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}\n\\bibitem{Xi2024} Y.~Xi, J.~Hu, J.~Luo \\emph{et al.}, ``Impact of facet degree heterogeneity on phase transitions in infectious disease spread,'' \\emph{New Journal of Physics}, vol.~26, 2024.\n\\bibitem{Xie2022} B.~Xie, M.~Liu and L.~Zhang, ``Bifurcation analysis and optimal control of SEIR epidemic model with saturated treatment function on the network,'' \\emph{Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering}, vol.~19, no.~2, pp.~1677--1696, 2022.\n\\end{thebibliography}\n\n\\end{document}",
