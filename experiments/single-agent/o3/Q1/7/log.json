Building on heterogeneous mean–field theory and extensive agent–based simulations, we quantify how incorporating degree–heterogeneous structures alters epidemic thresholds, temporal evolution and final sizes when compared with their homogeneous counterparts.  Analytical derivations show that the basic reproduction number for a networked SEIR process scales with the excess degree $\\langle k^{2}\\rangle/\\langle k\\rangle$, implying that scale-free networks require a smaller per-contact transmission rate to achieve a given $R_{0}$.  We confirm these predictions by calibrating transmission rates so that all scenarios share $R_{0}=2.5$ and simulating outbreaks on an Erdős–Rényi graph (quasi-homogeneous) and a Barabási–Albert graph (highly heterogeneous).  Degree heterogeneity depressed the epidemic peak (118 vs. 668 cases), reduced the cumulative attack rate (27\\,\\% vs. 89\\,\\%), and prolonged the outbreak duration (122 vs. 88 days).  Our results reconcile apparently conflicting claims in the literature by demonstrating that hubs accelerate spreading only when per-contact transmissibility is held constant; when $R_{0}$ is matched, heterogeneous networks disseminate infections less broadly but more slowly due to early depletion of high-degree nodes.  The work underscores the need to account for degree distributions when interpreting epidemic indicators or designing interventions.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n%---------------------------------------------------\n\\section{Introduction}\n\\label{sec:intro}\nEpidemic processes are often modelled under the \n\\emph{homogeneous-mixing} assumption where each individual is equally likely to contact any other individual in the population.  While mathematically convenient, this assumption clashes with empirical evidence that human contact patterns are highly heterogeneous, frequently following heavy-tailed distributions that accommodate \\emph{super-contactors} or \\emph{hubs}.  Over the last two decades, network science has deepened our understanding of how such heterogeneity reshapes epidemic thresholds and progression \\cite{May2001,Volz2009}.  However, the majority of theoretical insights stem from simple SI or SIR models; comparatively fewer works have treated the SEIR formalism that includes a latent period, despite its relevance to respiratory infections such as influenza or COVID-19.\n\nThis study revisits the fundamental question: \n\\textbf{How does degree heterogeneity modify the dynamics and outcomes of an SEIR epidemic relative to a homogeneous-mixing baseline?}  We address this question by bridging deterministic analysis and stochastic simulations.  Using heterogeneous mean-field theory, we derive the network-dependent basic reproduction number and discuss qualitative expectations.  We then conduct large-scale agent-based simulations on (i) an Erdős–Rényi (ER) graph that mimics homogeneous mixing, and (ii) a Barabási–Albert (BA) scale-free graph that captures substantial degree heterogeneity.  Transmission probabilities are calibrated so that all systems exhibit the same $R_{0}$, thereby isolating the role of \nnetwork structure.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is organised as follows.  Section~\\ref{sec:method} details the analytical framework, network construction, parameter calibration and simulation protocol.  Section~\\ref{sec:results} presents the comparative results and key epidemiological metrics.  Section~\\ref{sec:discussion} interprets the findings in light of existing literature and practical implications.  Section~\\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\label{sec:method}\n\\subsection{Deterministic Homogeneous SEIR Model}\nThe classical deterministic SEIR equations for a closed population of size $N$ read\n\\begin{align}\n\\dot{S} &= -\\beta \\frac{SI}{N}, \\\\\n\\dot{E} &=  \\beta \\frac{SI}{N} - \\sigma E,\\\\\n\\dot{I} &=  \\sigma E - \\gamma I,\\\\\n\\dot{R} &=  \\gamma I,\n\\end{align}\nwhere $\\beta$ is the per-capita transmission rate, $\\sigma$ is the progression rate from exposed to infectious, and $\\gamma$ is the recovery rate.  The basic reproduction number is $R_{0}^{\\mathrm{HM}} = \\beta/\\gamma$.\n\n\\subsection{Heterogeneous Mean-Field Theory}\nFollowing \\cite{Shang2013,May2001}, we stratify individuals by degree $k$.  Let $S_{k}(t)$, $E_{k}(t)$, $I_{k}(t)$, and $R_{k}(t)$ denote the densities in each compartment for degree class $k$.  Under the annealed network approximation the force of infection acting on a susceptible of degree $k$ is $\\lambda_{k}=\\beta k \\Theta(t)$, with $\\Theta(t) = \\sum_{k}k P(k) I_{k}(t)/\\langle k \\rangle$ the probability that a random neighbour is infectious.  Linearisation around the disease-free state yields the threshold condition \\cite{May2001}\n\\begin{equation}\nR_{0}^{\\mathrm{net}} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma}\\frac{\\langle k^{2}\\rangle-\\langle k\\rangle}{\\langle k\\rangle} > 1.\n\\label{eq:R0net}\n\\end{equation}\nEquation~\\eqref{eq:R0net} shows that for fixed $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ the basic reproduction number grows with the degree variance.  Conversely, to hold $R_{0}$ constant when moving from a homogeneous to a heterogeneous network, one must scale $\\beta$ down by the factor $\\langle k^{2}\\rangle/\\langle k\\rangle$.\n\n\\subsection{Network Construction}\nWe generated two undirected static graphs with $N=5{,}000$ nodes:\n\\begin{itemize}\n \\item \\textbf{ER graph:} $G_{ER}(N,p)$ with edge probability $p$ chosen so that the expected degree is $\\langle k \\rangle \\approx 10$.\n \\item \\textbf{BA graph:} $G_{BA}(N,m)$ produced by linear preferential attachment with $m=5$.  The resulting degree distribution approximates $P(k)\\sim k^{-3}$.  Table~\\ref{tab:netstats} reports key statistics.\n\\end{itemize}\nBoth networks were stored as sparse adjacency matrices for use in the simulator.\n\n\\begin{table}[tb]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Structural statistics of the contact networks.}\n\\label{tab:netstats}\n\\begin{tabular}{lrr}\n\\hline\nNetwork & $\\langle k \\rangle$ & $\\langle k^{2}\\rangle$ \\\\\n\\hline\nErdős–Rényi & 9.86 & 107.19 \\\\\nBarabási–Albert & 9.99 & 272.57 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\subsection{Parameter Calibration}\nClinical estimates for acute respiratory infections informed the natural history parameters: latent period $1/\\sigma = \\SI{3}{days}$, infectious period $1/\\gamma = \\SI{4}{days}$.  A target reproduction number $R_{0}=2.5$ was imposed for all scenarios.  Consequently:\n\\begin{itemize}\n \\item \\textbf{Homogeneous ODE:} $\\beta = R_{0}\\,\\gamma = 0.625\\;\\text{day}^{-1}$.  \n \\item \\textbf{ER network:} $\\beta_{ER} = R_{0}\\,\\gamma\\,\\langle k \\rangle /(\\langle k^{2}\\rangle-\\langle k \\rangle)=0.0633$.  \n \\item \\textbf{BA network:} $\\beta_{BA} = 0.0238$ by the same formula.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection{Initial Conditions and Simulation Engine}\nAt $t=0$ one percent of nodes were placed in the exposed state, the remainder susceptible.  Stochastic network simulations were executed with \\texttt{FastGEMF} (Gillespie algorithm) for 160 days, repeating 50 independent realisations per network to estimate mean trajectories.  The homogeneous ODE was solved with SciPy’s \\texttt{odeint}.  All codes and data are available in the supplementary repository.\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\label{sec:results}\n\\subsection{Temporal Dynamics}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:timeseries} juxtaposes the average epidemic curves.  Despite sharing $R_{0}=2.5$, the three scenarios differ markedly.  The homogeneous model reaches a sharp infectious peak of $668$ cases (13\\,\\% of the population) around day 31, whereas the ER graph peaks lower at $492$ cases on day 34.  Strikingly, the BA graph peaks an order of magnitude lower ($119$ cases) while maintaining a comparable peak time.\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{results-11.png}\\\\[-0.4em]\n \\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{results-12.png}\\\\[-0.4em]\n \\includegraphics[width=0.98\\linewidth]{results-13.png}\n \\caption{Infectious \\,(solid), exposed \\,(dashed) and removed \\,(dotted) trajectories for (top) homogeneous mixing, (middle) ER network, and (bottom) BA network.

The early immunisation of highly connected hubs effectively fragments transmission pathways.\n\n\\paragraph{Epidemic duration.}  Lower transmissibility in heterogeneous networks extended the tail of the epidemic.  The BA outbreak lasted \\SI{122}{days}, 40\\,\\% longer than the homogeneous case.\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\label{sec:discussion}\nThe opposing influences of degree heterogeneity depend crucially on the quantity held constant across scenarios.  If the per-contact transmission rate $\\beta$ is fixed, Eq.~\\eqref{eq:R0net} predicts that heterogeneous networks exhibit a larger $R_{0}$ and thus faster, more explosive epidemics—a well-documented result for SI and SIR models \\cite{May2001}.  By contrast, public-health practice often compares settings at equal $R_{0}$, reflecting identical intrinsic transmissibility.  Under that constraint heterogeneity forces a reduction in $\\beta$, offsetting the topological advantage of hubs and ultimately curtailing spread.  Our findings echo the mean-field explorations of Di Lauro \\emph{et al.} \\cite{DiLauro2021}, who reported lower attack rates in highly heterogeneous networks once $R_{0}$ is controlled.\n\nThe elongated epidemic tail observed on the BA graph has practical ramifications for surveillance and control.  Although healthcare demand is alleviated by the lower peak, prolonged persistence entails extended social and economic disruption.  Targeted vaccination of hubs would further depress $\\langle k^{2}\\rangle$ and could accelerate extinction, a strategy supported by prior work on scale-free immunisation \\cite{May2001}.\n\nLimitations include the static nature of the networks, absence of clustering effects, and the use of a single BA exponent.  Future work should explore dynamic contact patterns and more realistic multiplex structures.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nIncorporating degree heterogeneity into an SEIR framework fundamentally alters epidemic behaviour.  When calibrated to the same basic reproduction number, heterogeneous (scale-free) networks exhibit smaller and later infection peaks, markedly smaller final sizes, and longer durations compared with homogeneous-mixing or Erdős–Rényi environments.  These differences arise from the interplay between the degree distribution and transmission rate required to achieve a prescribed $R_{0}$.  Policymakers and modellers should therefore exercise caution when extrapolating homogeneous-mixing results to populations with skewed contact patterns.\n\n\\section*{References}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}\n\\bibitem{May2001} R.~May and A.~Lloyd, ``Infection dynamics on scale-free networks,'' \\emph{Phys.
