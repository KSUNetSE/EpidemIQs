                    "abstract": "An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy with a strong contagion rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and the number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 24, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and the uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the initial number of exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infectious periods, and the fatality rate. First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order for the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infectious human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (May 5, 2020) and constrain the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (March 31) approximately, with a reproduction ratio R0 of 3 initially, 1.36 at day 22, and 0.8 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is approximately 15,600 casualties, with 2.7 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit to the dead individuals is 4.25 days, and the infectious period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57%, and it is 2.37% if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initial number of exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47%. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infectious periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 vs. 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 vs. 0.57%), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Other choices of the set of parameters also provide a good fit to the data, but some of the results may not be realistic. Therefore, an accurate determination of the fatality rate and characteristics of the epidemic is subject to knowledge of the precise bounds of the parameters. Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing, and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, it is important to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the lockdown.",

We consider a broad setting where we allow severe degree heterogeneity and a wide range of sparsity levels, and propose Stepwise Goodness of Fit (StGoF) as a new approach. This is a stepwise algorithm, where for , we alternately use a community detection step and a goodness of fit (GoF) step. We adapt SCORE Jin for community detection, and propose a new GoF metric. We show that at step m, the GoF metric diverges to in probability for all m < K and converges to N(0, 1) if m = K. This gives rise to a consistent estimate for K. Also, we discover the right way to define the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for our problem and show that consistent estimates for K do not exist if , and StGoF is uniformly consistent for K if . Therefore, StGoF achieves the optimal phase transition. Similar stepwise methods are known to face analytical challenges. We overcome the challenges by using a different stepwise scheme in StGoF and by deriving sharp results that are not available before. The key to our analysis is to show that SCORE has the Nonsplitting Property (NSP). Primarily due to a nontractable rotation of eigenvectors dictated by the Davis\u2013Kahan theorem, the NSP is nontrivial to prove and requires new techniques we develop.

However, how this distribution arises has not been conclusively demonstrated in direct analyses of people's actions in social networks. Here, we perform a causal inference analysis and find an underlying cause for this phenomenon. Our analysis indicates that heavy-tailed degree distribution is causally determined by similarly skewed distribution of human activity. Specifically, the degree of an individual is entirely random - following a \u201cmaximum entropy attachment\u201d model - except for its mean value which depends deterministically on the volume of the users' activity. This relation cannot be explained by interactive models, like preferential attachment, since the observed actions are not likely to be caused by interactions with other people.",

Standard SEIR models distinguish essentially two regimes: either the disease is controlled and the number of infected people rapidly decreases, or the disease spreads and contaminates a significant fraction of the population until herd immunity is achieved. After lockdown, at first sight it seems that social distancing is not enough to control the outbreak. We discuss here a possible explanation, namely that the lockdown is creating social heterogeneity: even if a large majority of the population complies with the lockdown rules, a small fraction of the population still has to maintain a normal or high level of social interactions, such as health workers, providers of essential services, etc. This results in an apparent high level of epidemic propagation as measured through re-estimations of the basic reproduction ratio. However, these measures are limited to averages, while variance inside the population plays an essential role on the peak and the size of the epidemic outbreak and tends to lower these two indicators. We provide theoretical and numerical results to sustain such a view.",

                    "abstract": "Temporal network data is often encoded as time-stamped interaction events between senders and receivers, such as co-authoring scientific articles or communication via email. A number of relational event frameworks have been proposed to address specific issues raised by complex temporal dependencies. These models attempt to quantify how individual behaviour, endogenous and exogenous factors, as well as interactions with other individuals modify the network dynamics over time. It is often of interest to determine whether changes in the network can be attributed to endogenous mechanisms reflecting natural relational tendencies, such as reciprocity or triadic effects. The propensity to form or receive ties can also, at least partially, be related to actor attributes. Nodal heterogeneity in the network is often modelled by including actor-specific or dyadic covariates. However, comprehensively capturing all personality traits is difficult in practice, if not impossible. A failure to account for heterogeneity may confound the substantive effect of key variables of interest. This work shows that failing to account for node level sender and receiver effects can induce ghost triadic effects. We propose a random-effect extension of the relational event model to deal with these problems. We show that it is often effective over more traditional approaches, such as in-degree and out-degree statistics. These results that the violation of the hierarchy principle due to insufficient information about nodal heterogeneity can be resolved by including random effects in the relational event model as a standard.",

More specifically, the models are formulated both on the population with and without permanent natural immunity to infection, which corresponds respectively to the susceptible-vaccinated-infected-quarantined-recovered (SVIQR) model and the susceptible-vaccinated-infected-quarantined (SVIQS) model. We develop different mathematical methods to study the dynamics of two models, including the basic reproduction number, the global stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria. For the SVIQR model, we show that the system exhibits a forward bifurcation. Meanwhile, the disease-free and unique endemic equilibria are shown to be globally asymptotically stable by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions. For the SVIQS model, conditions ensuring the occurrence of multiple endemic equilibria are derived. Under certain conditions, this system cannot undergo a backward bifurcation. The global asymptotical stability of disease-free equilibrium, and the persistence of the disease are proved. The endemic equilibrium is shown to be globally attractive by using monotone iterative technique. Finally, stochastic network simulations yield quantitative agreement with the deterministic mean-field approach.",

Finally, numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the effect of network structures and model parameters on the basic reproduction numbers and disease spreading processes.",
