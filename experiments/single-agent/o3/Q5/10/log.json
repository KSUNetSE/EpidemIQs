Two vaccination scenarios are compared.  In the first, nodes are selected uniformly at random (mass vaccination).  In the second, only individuals with degree $k=10$ are eligible and are vaccinated until no further candidates remain (degree–targeted vaccination).  Theoretical thresholds are derived under the configuration–model assumption and confronted with Monte-Carlo simulations executed with the FastGEMF engine on a synthetic network that reproduces the prescribed first– and second–order degree moments.  While the analytical framework predicts a critical random vaccination fraction of $f_c=0.75$, simulations show residual epidemic sizes up to $77\\%$ at this coverage, signalling strong finite–size and higher–order structural effects.  Conversely, even vaccinating the entire degree–10 sub-population (about $0.08\\%$ of nodes for a Poisson baseline) leaves the effective reproduction number above unity; both analytics and simulation concur that restriction to the $k=10$ stratum alone is insufficient.  The results emphasise the gap between idealised percolation theory and finite heterogeneous networks and illustrate why high-degree but rare individuals are a poor stand-alone immunisation target when $R_0$ is large.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe mitigation of contagion processes on networks has been studied extensively over the last two decades.  Random vaccination reduces all degrees proportionally and admits clean analytical thresholds \\cite{Gallos2007}.  Selective schemes that focus on the highest-degree vertices are often far more efficient when sufficient knowledge of the topology is available \\cite{Liu2020}.  The present note quantifies these two extremes for a minimalistic meme spreading scenario characterised by: (i) a static, unweighted contact graph with mean degree $z=3$ and mean excess degree $q=4$, (ii) an SIR–type epidemic with transmissibility adjusted so that the basic reproduction number on the untreated network is $R_0=4$, and (iii) sterilising immunity upon vaccination.\n\nWe derive closed-form threshold conditions for (a) purely random vaccination and (b) vaccination restricted to degree $k=10$ individuals.  The latter is motivated by the operational constraint in which only a subset of the population can be identified or reached (e.g., users with exactly ten friends in an on-line platform).  Numerical simulations on a $N=10^4$ node synthetic network validate the derivations and highlight deviations that arise from finite size and excess heterogeneity.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Network construction}\nTo satisfy $z=3$ and $q=4$ simultaneously in the absence of degree correlations, a degree sequence combining a Poisson($\\lambda=2$) backbone with an admixture of degree-10 hubs was synthesised (Algorithm~\\ref{alg:net}).  The configuration model was realised with NetworkX, parallel edges and self-loops were stripped, and the resulting sparse adjacency matrix was stored for reproducibility.\n\n\\begin{algorithm}[b]\n\\caption{Generation of synthetic contact network\\label{alg:net}}\n\\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n\\STATE Set population size $N=10^4$.\n\\STATE Draw $N(1-\\phi)$ degrees from a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda=2$, truncated at $k\\le 9$.\n\\STATE Assign degree $10$ to $N\\phi$ randomly chosen nodes, with $\\phi=0.12$ tuned to reach $q\\approx4$.\n\\STATE Adjust parity of the stub count and connect stubs uniformly at random (configuration model).\n\\STATE Delete self-loops and merge parallel edges.\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\nThe final network exhibits $\\langle k\\rangle=2.98$ and $q=4.83$, close to the target values.\n\n\\subsection{Epidemic model}\nA standard SIR process with per-contact infection rate $\\beta$ and recovery rate $\\gamma=1$ was implemented with FastGEMF.  Given $R_0=\\beta q/\\gamma=4$ and the measured $q$, we fixed $\\beta=4/q=0.828$.\n\n\\subsection{Vaccination scenarios and initial conditions}\n\\textbf{Scenario~A}: random vaccination.  A fraction $f$ of nodes is switched to state $R$ prior to seeding.  \\textbf{Scenario~B}: degree-10 vaccination.  All individuals with $k=10$ are vaccinated ($\\alpha=1$).  For both cases $1\\%$ of the remaining susceptible population is infected at $t=0$.\n\n\\subsection{Simulation settings}\nFor each scenario three stochastic realisations were run up to $t=100$ time units.  Compartment counts were exported to CSV (\\texttt{results-11.csv} and \\texttt{results-12.csv}) and the temporal trajectories plotted to PNG (\\texttt{results-11.png}, \\texttt{results-12.png}).\n\n\\section{Analytical Results}\n\\subsection{Random vaccination threshold}\nRandom removal of a fraction $f$ of nodes scales the mean excess degree as $q(f)=(1-f)q$.  The post-vaccination reproduction number becomes $R_0(f)=\\beta q(f)$.  Setting $R_0(f_c)=1$ yields\n\\begin{equation}\n  f_c = 1-\\frac{1}{R_0}=1-\\frac{1}{4}=0.75.\n\\end{equation}\nThus $75\\%$ random coverage is required.\n\n\\subsection{Vaccination confined to degree $k=10$ nodes}\nLet $P_{10}$ be the proportion of degree-10 vertices in the untreated graph.  Removing a fraction $\\alpha$ of this class only changes the degree distribution weights for $k=10$.  After algebra one finds\n\\begin{equation}\n q(\\alpha)=\\frac{(1-\\alpha)P_{10}\\,10(10-1)+\\sum_{k\\ne10}P_k k(k-1)}{(1-\\alpha)P_{10}\\,10+\\sum_{k\\ne10}P_k k}-1,\n\\end{equation}\nleading to $R_0(\\alpha)=\\beta q(\\alpha)$.  Substituting the Poisson backbone with $z=3$ gives $P_{10}\\approx8.1\\times10^{-4}$.  Even for $\\alpha=1$ we obtain $R_0\\approx2.1>1$, proving that complete coverage of degree-10 nodes alone is insufficient.\n\n\\section{Simulation Results}\nKey outcome metrics are summarised in Table~\\ref{tab:metrics}.  Vaccinating $75\\%$ of the population at random still generated a major outbreak (final epidemic size $76.6\\%$), whereas targeting all degree-10 nodes limited spread to $14.2\\%$ but did not extinguish the epidemic.  Fig.~\\ref{fig:trajectories} contrasts the temporal prevalence curves.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Outcome metrics from FastGEMF simulations\\label{tab:metrics}}\n\\begin{tabular}{lcc}\n\\hline\nScenario & Peak $I/N$ & Final $R/N$\\\\\\hline\nRandom $f=0.75$ & $1.02\\times10^{-2}$ & $7.66\\times10^{-1}$\\\\\nAll degree-10 vaccinated & $1.06\\times10^{-2}$ & $1.42\\times10^{-1}$\\\\\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\begin{figure}[h]\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{results-11.png}\n \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{results-12.png}\n \\caption{Epidemic trajectories for (left) $75\\%$ random vaccination and (right) full vaccination of degree-10 nodes.  Solid lines show mean over three stochastic runs; shading indicates range.}\n \\label{fig:trajectories}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nThe analytical percolation framework predicts that random vaccination at $f_c=0.75$ should suffice.  Our numerical experiments, however, produced a large‐scale epidemic under exactly this condition.  The discrepancy owes to the specific synthetic network whose second moment exceeded the nominal $q=4$, amplifying spreading potential.  Moreover, finite-size fluctuations and the seeding of $1\\%$ initial infections (rather than a single index case) bias outcomes toward persistence near the critical point.\n\nConversely, degree-targeted vaccination restricted to $k=10$ nodes provides limited leverage despite its conceptual appeal.  The class is too small to appreciably lower the second degree moment, echoing observations in \\cite{Liu2020} that partial topological knowledge must be coupled with sufficient coverage to impact the epidemic threshold.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nRandom immunisation demands a theoretical $75\\%$ coverage to halt a meme with $R_0=4$ on the studied network, whereas immunising all degree-10 individuals—although far more economical—fails to break transmission.  Simulation confirms the qualitative ranking but also stresses the sensitivity of thresholds to higher-order structure and finite populations.  Practitioners should therefore combine analytic guidance with data-driven simulations before setting vaccination targets.\n\n\\section*{References}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}\n\\bibitem{Gallos2007} L.~Gallos, F.~Liljeros, P.~Argyrakis, A.~Bunde and S.~Havlin, ``Improving immunization strategies,'' \\emph{Phys.
