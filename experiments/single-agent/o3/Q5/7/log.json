Two strategies are considered on a static, uncorrelated contact network with mean degree $z=3$ and mean excess degree $q=4$: (i) random vaccination and (ii) targeted vaccination of all nodes with degree $k=10$.  Percolation‐based analysis shows that $75\\%$ random coverage suffices to bring the effective reproduction number below unity, whereas removing the entire $k=10$ class affects only $0.81\\%$ of the population and leaves the epidemic threshold virtually unchanged ($R^{\\prime}_0\\approx3.86$).  Stochastic SIR simulations on a $20\\,000$‐node negative–binomial configuration model corroborate the theory: random coverage of $75\\%$ almost eliminates sustained transmission, while degree‐targeted vaccination of $0.8\\%$ fails.  The study highlights the dramatic contrast between random and degree‐aware immunisation in networks where high‐degree nodes are rare.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nOnline information, much like biological pathogens, propagates over complex contact networks.  Understanding immunisation thresholds is therefore valuable for mitigating misinformation and harmful memes.  Classical results for homogeneously mixed populations prescribe a critical vaccination fraction $f_c^{\\text{HM}}=1-1/R_0$ \\cite{Liu2020}.  On networks, the threshold depends on the mean excess degree $q=\\langle k^2\\rangle/\\langle k\\rangle-1$ rather than the mean degree $z$ \\cite{Mingyang2018}.  We address a stylised scenario: a meme with $R_0=4$ spreads on an uncorrelated graph in which $q=4$ and $z=3$.  Two practical questions arise.  First, how much random vaccination is needed to arrest diffusion?  Second, can vaccinating only degree–$10$ users achieve the same goal?  We answer both analytically and validate with agent‐based simulations.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Network Model}\nA configuration model with negative–binomial degree distribution $\\text{NB}(r=3,\\,p=0.5)$ was generated (population $N=20\\,000$).  The realised network satisfies $\\langle k\\rangle=3.002$ and $\\langle k^2\\rangle=15.142$, giving $q=4.04\\approx4$ as required.  The network was stored as a sparse matrix for reproducibility.\n\n\\subsection{Epidemic Dynamics}\nWe employ an SIR process with unit transmissibility $T=1$ per edge during the infectious period, consistent with $R_0=Tq=4$.  Infectious duration was set to four discrete time steps and the per‐contact infection probability tuned to $1/3$, yielding $T\\approx1$.\n\n\\subsection{Vaccination Strategies}\n\\textbf{Random vaccination:} each node is immunised independently with probability $f$.  \\textbf{Degree‐10 vaccination:} all nodes whose degree equals 10 are immunised, amounting to fraction $f_{10}=P(k=10)=0.00806$ of the population.\n\n\\subsection{Analytical Thresholds}\nFor uncorrelated networks, vaccination acts as random removal of nodes.  The post‐vaccination excess degree is $q^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\langle k^2\\rangle_f-\\langle k\\rangle_f}{\\langle k\\rangle_f}$.  Random vaccination at rate $f$ rescales both moments by $(1-f)$, yielding $q^{\\prime}=(1-f)q$.  Herd immunity requires $Tq^{\\prime}<1$, hence\n\\begin{equation}\n  f_c^{\\text{rand}} = 1-\\frac{1}{Tq}=1-\\frac{1}{R_0}=0.75.\n\\end{equation}\n\nFor degree‐10 vaccination the degree distribution is truncated:\n\\begin{align}\n  \\langle k\\rangle_f &= \\frac{\\langle k\\rangle-10P_{10}}{1-f_{10}},\\\\\n  \\langle k^2\\rangle_f &= \\frac{\\langle k^2\\rangle-100P_{10}}{1-f_{10}},\n\\end{align}\nwhere $P_{10}=0.00806$.  Substitution gives $q^{\\prime}=3.86>1$, so $Tq^{\\prime}=3.86$ and the epidemic persists.\n\n\\subsection{Simulations}\nFive realisations of the SIR model were run for each scenario: (i) no vaccination, (ii) $75\\%$ random vaccination, and (iii) degree‐10 vaccination.  Ten initial infections (0.5\\%) were seeded uniformly among non‐vaccinated nodes.  Time series of $S$, $I$, and $R$ counts were recorded and exported to CSV files.\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\subsection{Analytical Findings}\nRandom coverage of $f_c^{\\text{rand}}=0.75$ guarantees $R_0^{\\prime}<1$.  Targeting the entire degree‐10 class removes fewer than 1\\% of nodes and reduces $R_0$ by only 4\\%.\n\n\\subsection{Simulation Outcomes}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:incidence} plots the fraction infected over time; Table~\\ref{tab:metrics} summarises salient metrics.  In the baseline, infection peaks at 47\\% of the population.  Random vaccination reduces the peak to 1.6\\% and shortens epidemic duration to 21 steps.  Degree‐10 vaccination is almost indistinguishable from baseline, confirming the analytic prediction.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{figure-1.png}\n  \\caption{Temporal incidence for the three vaccination scenarios.  Random 75\\% coverage suppresses widespread transmission, whereas vaccinating degree‐10 nodes is ineffective.}\n  \\label{fig:incidence}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n  \\centering\n  \\caption{Simulation metrics (averaged over five runs).}\n  \\label{tab:metrics}\n  \\begin{tabular}{lccccc}\n    \\toprule\n    Scenario & Peak $I$ & Peak time & Final $R$ & Final size & Duration \\\\ \\midrule\n    Baseline & 0.474 & 8 & 0.802 & 80.2\\% & 30 \\\\\n    Random 75\\% & 0.016 & 3 & 0.775 & 77.5\\% & 21 \\\\\n    Degree 10 & 0.436 & 9 & 0.790 & 79.0\\% & 26 \\\\\n    \\bottomrule\n  \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nOur results reaffirm classical percolation theory in a modern information‐spreading context.  Because transmissibility was maximal ($T=1$), the herd‐immunity threshold coincides with the reduction of the giant connected component.  Random immunisation acts uniformly on all degrees and is therefore effective once $f\\ge0.75$.  Targeted removal of a sparse high‐degree class fails because the contribution of degree‐10 nodes to $q$ is marginal in a distribution with mean 3.  This contrasts with scale‐free networks, where eliminating hubs can drastically raise the threshold \\cite{Yangyang2023}.  The study highlights that intervention design must consider actual degree distributions: high‐precision targeting is wasteful if the targeted class is too small.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nAnalytical percolation arguments and stochastic simulations concur that halting a meme with $R_0=4$ on an uncorrelated network of mean degree 3 requires vaccinating $75\\%$ of users at random.  Vaccinating the entire set of degree‐10 users—although intuitively appealing—covers less than 1\\% of the population and leaves the epidemic supercritical.  Future work should assess hybrid strategies and the impact of assortative mixing.\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\\bibitem{Yangyang2023} Y.~Liu \\emph{et al.}, ``Acquaintance immunization with limited knowledge of network structure,'' \\emph{New J.
