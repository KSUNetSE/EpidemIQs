                    "abstract": "Many complex systems can be modeled as directed networks, which can be regarded as a generalization of undirected networks. In this paper, epidemic dynamics and immunization strategies in directed networks are studied. First, a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model on a directed network is established employing the mean-field method, and its dynamics and epidemic threshold of the network are studied. Then based on the continuous degree technique, namely, considering the degree of a node as a continuous variable, we propose a method to calculate the epidemic threshold of the immunized network. Besides, some immunization strategies, including optimal immunization, random immunization, combined targeted immunization, and combined acquaintance immunization, and three special networks are considered. Finally, through numerical analysis, all immunization strategies are simulated and compared on different types of networks. We find that the nodes with the largest product of in-degree and out-degree are the most worthy of being immunized.",

Despite a number of studies based on the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model devoted to this topic, we still lack a general framework to compare different immunization strategies in completely random networks. Here, we address this problem by suggesting a novel method based on heterogeneous mean-field theory for the SIS model. Our method builds the relationship between the thresholds and different immunization strategies in completely random networks. Besides, we provide an analytical argument that the targeted large-degree strategy achieves the best performance in random networks with arbitrary degree distribution. Moreover, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both artificial and real-world networks.",

Our strategy retains the advantage of being purely local, without the need for knowledge on the global network structure or identification of the highest degree nodes. The method consists of selecting a random node and asking for a neighbor that has more links than himself or more than a given threshold and immunizing him. We compare this method to other efficient strategies on three real social networks and on a scale-free network model and find it to be significantly more effective.",
