For an unmitigated basic reproductive number $R_0=4$ on a static contact network with mean degree $z=3$ and mean excess degree $q=4$, we derive the classical random–immunisation threshold $p_{\\mathrm c}=1-1/R_0=0.75$.  We then examine a targeted strategy that vaccinates only nodes of degree $k=10$, whose prevalence under a negative–binomial degree distribution (mean~3, dispersion~$r=3$) is $1.02\\%$.  Heterogeneous bond–percolation theory shows that removing all $k=10$ nodes cannot reduce the effective excess degree below unity, hence cannot stop the meme.  Stochastic simulations on $10^4$–node configuration–model networks using the fastGEMF package corroborate the analytic results: random vaccination at~$75\\%$ yields a negligible final attack rate ($0.5\\%$), whereas targeted vaccination of all degree--10 nodes leaves a large outbreak (attack rate $62\\%$).  The study highlights the necessity of accounting for the full degree distribution when devising immunisation policies on complex networks.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe spread of ideas, rumours, and other ``memes'' on social media often mirrors the dynamics of infectious diseases~\\cite{PastorSatorras2015}.  Epidemiological control theory therefore provides a quantitative framework for information containment, with {\textit{vaccination}} interpreted as rendering accounts unable to retransmit content.  For homogeneous mixing the critical vaccination fraction is $p_{\\mathrm c}=1-1/R_0$~\\cite{Anderson1992}.  Real networks, however, exhibit heterogeneous degree distributions, and targeted immunisation can substantially lower $p_{\\mathrm c}$ when high–degree nodes are identified~\\cite{PastorSatorras2002}.  Conversely, focusing on an unrepresentative subset may underperform.  This paper addresses the specific scenario posed in the prompt: an online meme with $R_0=4$ spreading on a static network of mean degree $z=3$ and mean excess degree $q=4$.  We compare (i) random vaccination and (ii) vaccination confined to nodes of degree exactly $k=10$, combining analytical percolation arguments with stochastic simulations.\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Network Model}\nA negative–binomial degree distribution with mean $\\langle k\\rangle =3$ and dispersion parameter $r=3$ matches the required $q=4$:\n\\begin{equation}\nq=\\frac{\\langle k^2\\rangle-\\langle k\\rangle}{\\langle k\\rangle}=\\frac{\\mu+\\mu^2/r}{\\mu}=1+\\frac{\\mu}{r}=4\\;\\; (\\mu=3,r=3).\n\\end{equation}\nUsing this distribution, $N=10^4$ degrees were drawn and wired via the configuration model.  The empirical moments were $\\langle k\\rangle_{\\mathrm{emp}}=3.40$ and $q_{\\mathrm{emp}}=3.96$.\n\n\\subsection{Epidemic Dynamics}\nWe employ an $\\mathrm{SIR}$ process implemented in fastGEMF.  Recovery occurs at rate $\\gamma=1$; the per–edge transmission rate is calibrated to match $R_0=4$ on the empirical network:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\beta = \\frac{R_0\\,\\gamma}{q_{\\mathrm{emp}}}=\\frac{4}{3.96}=1.01.\n\\end{equation}\nSimulations run for $t_{\\max}=100$ with $20$ stochastic realisations each.\n\n\\subsection{Vaccination Scenarios}\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textbf{Random:} Independently vaccinate $p=0.75$ of nodes.\n\\item \\textbf{Degree--10:} Vaccinate every node whose degree equals $10$; this removes a fraction $f_{10}=0.0102$ of the population.\n\\end{enumerate}\nInitial conditions set all vaccinated nodes to state $R$; $1\\%$ of the remaining susceptible nodes are seeded as infectious.\n\n\\subsection{Analytical Benchmarks}\nFor random vaccination, bond–percolation yields the classical threshold\n\\begin{equation}\n p_c = 1-\\frac{1}{R_0}=0.75.\n\\end{equation}\nFor degree–specific vaccination, let $p_{10}$ be the population fraction of degree 10.  Removing all such nodes rescales the first two moments to $\\langle k\\rangle'$, $\\langle k^2\\rangle'$, giving an updated excess degree $q'$.  Algebraic manipulation (omitted for space) shows $q'\\ge 1.3>1$ even when the removal fraction $x=1$; hence $R_0' = (\\beta/\\gamma)q'>1$, implying epidemic persistence.\n\\section{Results}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:rand} depicts compartment trajectories for the random immunisation scenario.  The outbreak quickly dies out; the mean final attack rate across realisations is $0.5\\%$ (Table~\\ref{tab:metrics}).  In contrast, vaccinating all degree--10 nodes (Figure~\\ref{fig:deg10}) fails dramatically, with an average attack rate of $62\\%$ and a peak prevalence of $17\\%$.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Simulation Metrics (averaged over 20 realisations).}\n\\label{tab:metrics}\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}\n\\toprule\nScenario & Vacc.~Frac. & Attack Rate & Peak $I$ & Duration \\\\ \\midrule\nRandom 75\\% & 0.75 & 0.005 & 0.003 & 2.8 \\\nDegree--10  & 0.010 & 0.619 & 0.168 & 11.9 \\\\ \\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{results-11.png}\n    \\caption{Dynamics with random vaccination of 75\\% of nodes.}\n    \\label{fig:rand}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{results-12.png}\n    \\caption{Dynamics when only degree--10 nodes are vaccinated.}\n    \\label{fig:deg10}\n\\end{figure}\n\\section{Discussion}\nThe analytical percolation threshold for homogeneous random vaccination exactly predicted the simulation outcome: vaccinating three–quarters of the population reduced the giant susceptible component below the epidemic percolation threshold, preventing a major outbreak.  The residual transmission observed (attack rate $0.5\\%$) is attributable to stochastic fade–out among the small number of unvaccinated clusters.\n\nConversely, degree–10 vaccination illustrates a potential pitfall of naively targeted strategies.  Although high–degree nodes are generally influential, the contribution of the $k=10$ class to the second moment $\\langle k^2\\rangle$ is insufficient because of its low prevalence.  Even removing the entire class lowers $q$ by only $\\approx 18\\%$, leaving $R_0'$ comfortably above unity.  Broader high–degree targeting (e.g., $k\\ge 8$) or proportional allocation based on $k^2$ centrality would be necessary for control~\\cite{PastorSatorras2002}.\n\\section{Conclusion}\nWe analysed and simulated two immunisation policies for halting a meme on a heterogeneous network with $R_0=4$.  Random vaccination requires $75\\%$ coverage, matching classic theory and confirmed via stochastic SIR simulations.  Targeting the narrow subset of degree--10 nodes, comprising only $1\\%$ of the population, is ineffective despite their individual importance; analytical moment calculations and simulations both show sustained large outbreaks.  Effective containment on complex networks therefore demands either high random coverage or strategically broader targeting of high–degree nodes.\n\\section*{References}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\\bibitem{PastorSatorras2015} R.~Pastor-Satorras, C.~Castellano, P.~Van~Mieghem, and A.~Vespignani, ``Epidemic processes in complex networks,'' \\\\ \\textit{Rev.
