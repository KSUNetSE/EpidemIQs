This peculiar connectivity provides an ideal environment for the spreading of infective agents. Here we show that the random uniform immunization of individuals does not lead to the eradication of infections in all complex networks. Namely, networks with scale-free properties do not acquire global immunity from major epidemic outbreaks even in the presence of unrealistically high densities of randomly immunized individuals. The absence of any critical immunization threshold is due to the unbounded connectivity fluctuations of scale-free networks. Successful immunization strategies can be developed only by taking into account the inhomogeneous connectivity properties of scale-free networks. In particular, targeted immunization schemes, based on the nodes' connectivity hierarchy, sharply lower the network's vulnerability to epidemic attacks.",

Specifically, the paper deals with three competing virus systems (i.e., tri-virus systems). First, we show that a tri-virus system, unlike a bi-virus system, is not a monotone dynamical system. Using the Parametric Transversality Theorem, we show that, generically, a tri-virus system has a finite number of equilibria and that the Jacobian matrices associated with each equilibrium are nonsingular. The endemic equilibria of this system can be classified as follows: a) single-virus endemic equilibria (also referred to as the boundary equilibria), where precisely one of the three viruses is alive; b) 2-coexistence equilibria, where exactly two of the three viruses are alive; and c) 3-coexistence equilibria, where all three viruses survive in the network. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition that guarantees local exponential convergence to a boundary equilibrium. Further, we secure conditions for the nonexistence of 3-coexistence equilibria (resp. for various forms of 2-coexistence equilibria). We also identify sufficient conditions for the existence of a 2-coexistence (resp. 3-coexistence) equilibrium. We identify conditions on the model parameters that give rise to a continuum of coexistence equilibria. More specifically, we establish i) a scenario that admits the existence and local exponential attractivity of a line of coexistence equilibria; and ii) scenarios that admit the existence of, and, in the case of one such scenario, global convergence to, a plane of 3-coexistence equilibria.",

Since the system is also monotone, it turns out that the typical behavior of the system is convergence to some equilibrium point.

For example, bond percolation models considering population heterogeneity have been used to provide insights into disease spread and misinformation control. However, most of these studies focus on single-layer contact networks. In our work, we examine how the spreading process is impacted by the existence of multiple contact network layers, considering layer-dependent population heterogeneity from a principled, mathematical perspective. Using SIR dynamics, we derive expressions for three key epidemiological measures: the probability of emergence, the epidemic threshold, and the expected epidemic size. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our analytical results match the numerical results near-perfectly in the finite node regime. These findings reveal the interplay among the multi-layer network structures, transmission dynamics, and population heterogeneity in determining the final outcome of the spreading process. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of layer-dependent population heterogeneity and identify important factors for developing effective and economical layer-oriented spreading control strategies. Overall, our work provides insights into developing and analyzing mitigation and control strategies for disease spread and information diffusion across multi-layer complex networks.",

Epidemic modeling and simulation are at the core of the healthcare efforts that are underway to assert some level of control over the spreading and the treatment of a pathogen. In this milieu, this paper describes a stochastic dynamic model to simulate the spreading of infectious diseases. We present the equations that describe the system dynamics, their adjoint systems, and their optimal control characterization by means of the discrete-system extension of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. This derivation is presented in two different cases: a vaccination policy and a combined vaccination-treatment approach. We show the behavior of such models via numerical simulations using the forward-backward sweep procedure.

Memory effects in the pattern of interactions among individuals are also known to affect how diffusive and spreading phenomena take place. In this paper we analyze the combined effect of these two ingredients on epidemic dynamics on networks. We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models on the recently introduced activity-driven networks with memory. By means of an activity-based mean-field approach, we derive, in the long-time limit, analytical predictions for the epidemic threshold as a function of the parameters describing the distribution of activities and the strength of the memory effects. Our results show that memory reduces the threshold, which is the same for SIS and SIR dynamics, therefore favoring epidemic spreading. The theoretical approach perfectly agrees with numerical simulations in the long-time asymptotic regime. Strong aging effects are present in the preasymptotic regime and the epidemic threshold is deeply affected by the starting time of the epidemics. We discuss in detail the origin of the model-dependent preasymptotic corrections, whose understanding could potentially allow for epidemic control on correlated temporal networks.",

In particular, we focus on how the epidemic threshold of the SIR model is affected by the heterogeneity of nodal activities and the memory strength in temporal and static regimes, respectively. While strong ties (memory) between nodes inhibit the spread of epidemic to be localized, the heterogeneity of nodal activities enhances it to be globalized initially. Since the epidemic threshold of the SIR model is very sensitive to the degree distribution of nodes in static networks, we test the SIR model on the modified ADTNs with the possible set of the activity exponents and the memory exponents that generates the same degree distributions in temporal networks. We also discuss the role of spatiotemporal scaling properties of the largest cluster and the maximum degree in the epidemic threshold. It is observed that the presence of highly active nodes enables to trigger the initial spread of epidemic in a short period of time, but it also limits its final spread to the entire network. This implies that there is the trade-off between the spreading time of epidemic and its outbreak size. Finally, we suggest the phase diagram of the SIR model on ADTNs and the optimal condition for the spread of epidemic under the circumstances.",

Here we investigate the impact of this ubiquitous feature by studying the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic models on activity driven networks with and without memory (i.e., Markovian and non-Markovian). We show that while memory inhibits the spreading process in SIR models, where the epidemic threshold is moved to larger values, it plays the opposite effect in the case of the SIS, where the threshold is lowered. The heterogeneity in tie strengths, and the frequent repetition of connections that it entails, allows in fact less virulent SIS-like diseases to survive in tightly connected local clusters that serve as reservoir for the virus. We validate this picture by evaluating the threshold of both processes in a real temporal network. Our findings confirm the important role played by non-Markovian network dynamics on dynamical processes.",

In addition, heterogeneity of interaction strengths and individual\u2019s memory have been proved to be important to affect network evolution in the area of complex networks. Based on a recent extension of the activity-driven modeling framework, i.e. activity-driven model with attractiveness, where individuals are characterized by their activities and attractiveness, we propose a new temporal network model by considering individuals\u2019 memory. Similar to the previous network model, we also investigate heterogeneous distributions and different correlations between the two variables (activity and attractiveness). By numerical simulations, we illustrate the impact of memory on epidemic spreading processes unfolding on the proposed model. We find that, when individuals\u2019 attractiveness is fixed, memory does not cause dramatic change on the epidemic threshold in the SIR process, but it inhibits the epidemic spreading by reducing the infected ratio. While for the SIS process, in the case of uncorrelated and positive correlations between the two variables, memory facilitates the epidemic outbreaks by shrinking the epidemic threshold. When the two variables are negatively correlated, memory does not take obvious impact on the epidemic threshold. Besides, for the two processes unfolding on the network with and without memory, the propagation threshold decreases with the enhancement of the positive correlation, however, it almost does not get much influence from the negative correlation strength. It indicates that for the individuals with same activity, more attractive individuals will promote the disease spread. The findings deepen our understanding of the role of individuals\u2019 memory and their attractiveness in the epidemic spreading process.",

                    "abstract": "The metapopulation framework is adopted in a wide array of disciplines to describe systems of well separated yet connected subpopulations. The subgroups or patches are often represented as nodes in a network whose links represent the migration routes among them. The connections have been so far mostly considered as static, but in general evolve in time. Here we address this case by investigating simple contagion processes on time-varying metapopulation networks. We focus on the SIR process and determine analytically the mobility threshold for the onset of an epidemic spreading in the framework of activity-driven network models. We find profound differences from the case of static networks. The threshold is entirely described by the dynamical parameters defining the average number of instantaneously migrating individuals and does not depend on the properties of the static network representation. Remarkably, the diffusion and contagion processes are slower in time-varying graphs than in their aggregated static counterparts, the mobility threshold being even two orders of magnitude larger in the first case. The presented results confirm the importance of considering the time-varying nature of complex networks.",

There have been multiple waves across the globe that emerged as a result of new variants, due to arising from unavoidable mutations. The existing network toolbox to study epidemic spreading cannot be readily adapted to the study of multiple, coexisting strains. In this context, particularly lacking are models that could elucidate re-infection with the same strain or a different strain\u2014phenomena that we are seeing experiencing more and more with COVID-19. Here, we establish a novel mathematical model to study the simultaneous spreading of two strains over a class of temporal networks. We build on the classical susceptible\u2013exposed\u2013infectious\u2013removed model, by incorporating additional states that account for infections and\u00a0re-infections with multiple strains. The temporal network is based on the activity-driven network paradigm, which has emerged as a model of choice to study dynamic processes that unfold at a time scale comparable to the network evolution. We draw analytical insight from the dynamics of the stochastic network systems through a mean-field approach, which allows for characterizing the onset of different behavioral phenotypes (non-epidemic, epidemic, and endemic). To demonstrate the practical use of the model, we examine an intermittent stay-at-home containment strategy, in which a fraction of the population is randomly required to isolate for a\u00a0fixed period of time.",

                    "abstract": "Over the past decade, the coupled spread of information and epidemic on multiplex networks has become an active and interesting topic. Recently, it has been shown that stationary and pairwise interactions have limitations in describing inter-individual interactions , and thus, the introduction of higher-order representation is significant. To this end, we present a new two-layer activity-driven network epidemic model, which considers the partial mapping relationship among nodes across two layers and simultaneously introduces simplicial complexes into one layer, to investigate the effect of 2-simplex and inter-layer mapping rate on epidemic transmission. In this model, the top network, called the virtual information layer, characterizes information dissemination in online social networks, where information can be diffused through simplicial complexes and/or pairwise interactions. The bottom network, named as the physical contact layer, denotes the spread of infectious diseases in real-world social networks. It is noteworthy that the correspondence among nodes between two networks is not one-to-one but partial mapping. Then, a theoretical analysis using the microscopic Markov chain (MMC) method is performed to obtain the outbreak threshold of epidemics, and extensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are also carried out to validate the theoretical predictions. It is obviously shown that MMC method can be used to estimate the epidemic threshold; meanwhile, the inclusion of simplicial complexes in the virtual layer or introductory partial mapping relationship between layers can inhibit the spread of epidemics. Current results are conducive to understanding the coupling behaviors between epidemics and disease-related information.",
