We analytically derive and numerically verify how the Susceptible--Infected--Recovered (SIR) dynamics with basic reproduction number $R_0=3$ unfold on an activity--driven temporal network and compare the outcome with a degree--heterogeneous but static Barabási–Albert (BA) network of identical population size.  Mean–field analysis predicts a higher critical infection rate for activity–driven systems than for static scale–free topologies.  Agent–based Monte Carlo simulations with $10^4$ individuals confirm that, under identical $R_0$, outbreaks on temporal networks are markedly smaller (final size $\\approx1.2\\%$) and shorter (\\(\\approx 40\\) days) than on static BA graphs (final size $\\approx18\\%$, duration $\\approx140$ days).  The work underscores the mitigating role of contact temporality relative to static heterogeneity and validates the theoretical thresholds proposed in recent literature.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nEpidemic modelling traditionally relies on static graphs that encode who–contacts–whom, implicitly assuming that connections persist over the epidemic time–scale.  Empirical evidence, however, shows that contacts blink on and off, altering the routes available for pathogen transmission.  The activity–driven framework \\cite{lei15, nadini20, tizzani18} offers a minimal yet analytically tractable description of such temporality by endowing each node with an intrinsic activity rate and rewiring its edges at every time step.  While for Susceptible–Infected–Susceptible (SIS) dynamics temporal variability can either hinder or promote persistence \\cite{sun15}, its effect on SIR outbreaks with fixed $R_0$ remains less explored.  This paper addresses the gap by contrasting SIR progression on a pure activity–driven network to that on a static heterogenous network with matching reproduction number.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Network Construction}\n\\textbf{Temporal network.}  We generated an activity–driven (AD) network with $N=10^4$ nodes.  Activity potentials $a$ were sampled from a power–law $F(a)\\sim a^{-\\alpha}$ ($\\alpha=2.5$, $a_{\\min}=10^{-3}$) and truncated to $1$.  At each discrete day, an active node creates $m=3$ transient links to randomly chosen peers; the graph is cleared before the next step.\n\n\\textbf{Static network.}  For comparison we built a Barabási–Albert graph with identical $N$ and average degree $\\langle k \\rangle\\simeq6$, saving the adjacency as \\texttt{network\\_static.npz}.  The degree distribution (Fig.~\\ref{fig:degree}) displays the expected power–law tail.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=.9\\linewidth]{degree_dist_static.png}\n \\caption{Degree distribution of the static BA network used in simulations.}\n \\label{fig:degree}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Analytical Infection Rates}\nLet $\\beta$ be the per–contact infection rate and $\\gamma=0.2\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$ the recovery rate (mean infectious period $5$ days).  To impose $R_0=3$ we exploit known expressions for the next–generation matrix spectral radius.\n\n\\paragraph{Activity–driven network.}\nFor SIR on an AD graph the effective reproductive number is $R_0=\\beta m (\\langle a \\rangle + \\sqrt{\\langle a^2 \\rangle})/\\gamma$ \\cite{lei15}.  With $\\langle a \\rangle=2.9\\times10^{-3}$ and $\\sqrt{\\langle a^2 \\rangle}=9.2\\times10^{-3}$ we obtain $\\beta_{\\text{AD}}=16.6\\,\\text{day}^{-1}$.\n\n\\paragraph{Static BA network.}\nOn static graphs $R_0=\\beta\\,(\\langle k^2\\rangle/\\langle k\\rangle-1)/\\gamma$ \\cite{nadini20}.  The BA network has $\\langle k \\rangle=6.0$ and $\\langle k^2 \\rangle=121.2$, yielding excess degree $q=19.2$ and $\\beta_{\\text{BA}}=0.031$.  Although $\\beta_{\\text{AD}}\\gg \\beta_{\\text{BA}}$, the temporally sparse contacts drastically reduce transmission opportunities.\n\n\\subsection{Simulation Protocol}\nWe implemented discrete–time Gillespie–style updates in Python and ran $10$ stochastic realisations per scenario for $T_{\\max}=200$ days.  Initial conditions were $1\\%$ randomly infected ($I_0=100$), remainder susceptible.  Source codes (\\texttt{simulation\\_temporal.py}, \\texttt{simulation\\_static.py}) and raw results (\\texttt{results-12.csv}, \\texttt{results-13.csv}) accompany this paper.\n\n\\section{Results}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:curves} contrasts the average epidemic trajectories.  Key metrics are summarised in Table~\\ref{tab:metrics}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=.9\\linewidth]{results-12.png}\\\\[3pt]\n \\includegraphics[width=.9\\linewidth]{results-13.png}\n \\caption{Top: SIR dynamics on the activity–driven temporal network.

In contrast, the static network supports a sizeable epidemic, infecting $\\approx18\\%$ of the population and persisting for nearly five months.  These findings align with the analytical expectation that the infection rate required to achieve a given $R_0$ is significantly larger when links are fleeting, and even when matched, the stochastic realisation may fail to ignite due to limited concurrent contacts.\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nOur combined theoretical and simulation study corroborates previous reports that temporality raises the epidemic threshold \\cite{tizzani18}.  The key mechanism is the dilution of concurrency: while highly active individuals create many links over time, they can transmit to only $m$ partners at each step, curtailing cascade formation.  Static heterogeneous graphs, by contrast, possess permanently wired hubs whose high degree amplifies spreading.  Although we tuned $\\beta$ to equalise $R_0$, the final sizes diverged, suggesting that $R_0$ alone is insufficient to characterise epidemic risk on temporal topologies.\n\nLimitations include the neglect of memory in contacts, finite–size effects, and the deterministic mapping from $R_0$ to $\\beta$ using mean–field formulas.  Future work may incorporate adaptive behaviour or multiplex layers \\cite{nadini20}.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nTemporal activity–driven contact structure strongly mitigates SIR outbreaks relative to an equally heterogeneous but static counterpart, even when the baseline reproduction number is held at three.  Analytical thresholds accurately predict the heightened infection rate required for invasion in temporal settings, and stochastic simulations verify the qualitative and quantitative reduction in epidemic magnitude.\n\n\\section*{References}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}\n\\bibitem{lei15} Y.~Lei, X.~Jiang and Q.~Guo, ``Contagion processes on the static and activity driven coupling networks,'' \\emph{Phys.
