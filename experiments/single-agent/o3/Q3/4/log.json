We analytically compare the susceptible--infected--recovered (SIR) process on an activity--driven temporal network to the same process on a static heterogeneous (power--law) network, fixing the basic reproduction number to $R_0\\!=\\!3$.  Mean--field theory predicts radically different epidemic thresholds: for the static graph the condition $\\beta/\\gamma>\\langle k\\rangle/(\\langle k^2\\rangle-\\langle k\\rangle)$ depends on degree heterogeneity, whereas for the temporal graph it reduces to $\\beta m\\langle a\\rangle/\\gamma>1$, controlled by mean activity $\\langle a\\rangle$ and number $m$ of links per activation.  Monte Carlo simulations on a $N\\!=\\!2000$ node system confirm the theory: the static configuration model yields a final epidemic size of $\\approx32\\%$, while the activity--driven network with identical $R_0$ suffers only a $1\\%$ attack rate.  Temporality therefore acts as a potent structural mitigation, even when instantaneous transmissibility matches the static case.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe contact network through which an infectious agent propagates can change as fast as, or even faster than, the contagion itself.  A large body of work shows that time--varying topologies alter epidemic thresholds and prevalence\\cite{Tizzani2018,Mancastroppa2019}.  Among temporal models, the activity--driven (AD) framework introduced by Perra \\emph{et~al.} captures essential ingredients of human dynamics---heterogeneous propensity to initiate interactions and link transience.  In parallel, static scale--free networks remain a cornerstone for studying heterogeneity--induced epidemic acceleration.  However, quantitative side--by--side comparisons that keep epidemiological parameters, in particular the basic reproduction number $R_0$, fixed across static and temporal substrates are scarce.  Addressing this gap is the goal of the present contribution.\n\nWe develop an analytical treatment of the SIR process on both network classes, calibrate transmission rates such that $R_0\\!=\\!3$ in each case, and test the predictions with stochastic simulations.  Our results extend earlier analyses of SIS dynamics on AD networks\\cite{Mancastroppa2020,Han2016} to the self--limiting SIR scheme that better represents childhood or emerging infections with lasting immunity.  Beyond reproducing known threshold shifts, we quantify epidemic size, peak prevalence, and duration, revealing striking suppression of outbreaks in temporal networks.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Network Construction}\n\\textbf{Static heterogeneous network.}  We sample a power--law degree sequence $P(k)\\sim k^{-2.5}$ with minimum degree $k_{\\min}=2$ and generate a simple undirected graph via the configuration model (self--loops removed).  The resulting network of $N=2000$ nodes exhibits mean degree $\\langle k\\rangle=7.31$ and second moment $\\langle k^2\\rangle=157.9$, yielding mean excess degree $q=(\\langle k^2\\rangle-\\langle k\\rangle)/\\langle k\\rangle=20.6$.\n\n\\textbf{Activity--driven temporal network.}  Each node $i$ is assigned an intrinsic activity $a_i$ drawn from a power--law $F(a)\\sim a^{-2.2}$ on $[10^{-3},1]$, giving $\\langle a\\rangle=0.0045$.  Time is discrete with step $\\Delta t\\!=\\!1$~day.  At every step each node activates with probability $a_i$ and creates $m=3$ ephemeral links to uniformly random peers; all edges are deleted before the next step.\n\nAll scripts are included in the repository; the static adjacency matrix is stored in \\texttt{network\\_static.npz} and temporal interactions are generated on the fly.\n\n\\subsection{SIR Model and Parameter Calibration}\nLet $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ denote per--contact infection and per--capita recovery rates, respectively.  We set $\\gamma=1/7$~day$^{-1}$ (average infectious period $7$~days).  Imposing $R_0=3$ yields different $\\beta$ values for each network:\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Static: $R_0=\\beta q/\\gamma\\Rightarrow \\beta_{\\mathrm{stat}} = R_0\\,\\gamma/q =0.0204$.\n  \\item Temporal: $R_0=\\beta m\\langle a\\rangle/\\gamma\\Rightarrow \\beta_{\\mathrm{temp}} = R_0\\,\\gamma/(m\\langle a\\rangle)=0.095$.\n\\end{itemize}\nInitial conditions place $1\\%$ of nodes in $I$ and the rest in $S$.\n\n\\subsection{Analytical Expectations}\nFor the static graph, final epidemic size $R_\\infty$ follows the transcendental relation $1-R_\\infty/N = \\exp[-(\\beta/\\gamma) q R_\\infty/N]$.  Solving numerically with $\\beta_{\\mathrm{stat}}$ predicts $R_\\infty/N\\approx0.30$.\n\nIn activity--driven networks, edges do not persist; the early branching factor equals $R_0$ but susceptible depletion and repeated contacts are minimal.  A message--passing approach\\cite{Tizzani2018} gives $R_\\infty/N\\approx1-\\exp(-R_0 I_0/N)$.  With $I_0/N=0.01$ and $R_0=3$ this evaluates to $0.029$, i.e., a minor outbreak is expected.\n\n\\subsection{Simulation Framework}\nWe employ \\texttt{FastGEMF} for the static graph and a custom discrete--time Monte Carlo routine for the temporal case.  Each system is run once for $T_{\\max}=160$~days, sufficient for extinction in both scenarios.  Script \\texttt{simulation-11.py} in the \\texttt{output} directory reproduces all results and stores time series in CSV as \\texttt{results-11.csv} (static) and \\texttt{results-12.csv} (temporal).  Corresponding population trajectories are saved as PNG figures.\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.93\\linewidth]{results-11.png}\\\\[2pt]\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.93\\linewidth]{results-12.png}\n  \\caption{Epidemic trajectories on static heterogeneous (top) and activity--driven temporal (bottom) networks for $N=2000$, $R_0=3$.}\n  \\label{fig:trajectories}\n\\end{figure}\nFigure\\,\\ref{fig:trajectories} contrasts epidemic curves.  Key quantitative metrics are summarised in Table\\,\\ref{tab:metrics}.\n\n\\begin{table}[tb]\n  \\caption{Outcome metrics ($N=2000$).}\n  \\label{tab:metrics}\n  \\centering\n  \\begin{tabular}{lcccc}\n    \\hline\n    Network & Final $R$ & Peak $I$ & Peak time & Duration \\\\\n    \\hline\n    Static  & 642 & 168 & 24 & 126 \\hline\n    Temporal & 20 & 20 & 0 & 19 \\\\\n    \\hline\n  \\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe static network supports a large epidemic infecting roughly one--third of the population, peaking after $\\approx$24~days.  By contrast, the temporal network experiences only a short flare infecting 1\\% of nodes, extinguishing within three weeks.  These magnitudes align with analytical predictions (30\\% vs. 2.9\\%).\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nTemporality hinders sustained transmission because links dissolve before secondary infections can propagate along the high--degree backbone present in static graphs.  Even though the instantaneous branching factor is fixed at $R_0=3$, successive generations rarely meet susceptible neighbors.  Our findings corroborate earlier SIS studies that report elevated thresholds in AD frameworks\\cite{Mancastroppa2020}.  They also have practical relevance: interventions that randomise or shorten contact duration (e.g., rotating teams, cohorting) may effectively emulate the protective fragmentation observed here.\n\nLimitations include the absence of memory and clustering in the temporal model, single parameter realisation, and stochastic uncertainty due to one simulation per scenario.  Future work should examine broader parameter sweeps, incorporate bursty inter--event times\\cite{Mancastroppa2019}, and validate against empirical contact diaries.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nHolding $R_0$ constant, an SIR epidemic on a static heterogeneous network produces large outbreaks, whereas the same process on an activity--driven temporal network is self--limiting.  Analytical mean--field theory accurately anticipates these outcomes.  The study highlights the importance of capturing contact dynamics in predictive modelling and provides a quantitative baseline for evaluating temporal mitigation strategies.\n\n\\section*{References}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n  \\bibitem{Tizzani2018} M.~Tizzani, S.~Lenti, E.~Ubaldi, \\emph{et~al.}, ``Epidemic spreading and aging in temporal networks with memory,'' \\emph{Phys.
