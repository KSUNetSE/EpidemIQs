This repository contains result artifacts generated by **EpidemIQs** across 10 specific inquiry questions(five used for evlaution in the main paper of **EpidemIQs**, and other five discussed in the supplementary material). 

To maintain a manageable project size, raw numerical data files have been **excluded** and only some samples are providd from this archive. However, all interpretative and functional files required to review the agent's logic and outputs are included.



##  How to Regenerate Numerical Results

The Python scripts included in this folder were generated by an AI agent operating within a specific directory structure. The agent assumes a shared working directory named `output`.

To run these scripts successfully and regenerate the numerical data, you must replicate the agent's environment pathing:

1.  Copy **all files** from the specific project run folder you wish to analyze. 
2.  Paste them directly into the **`output`** folder.
3.  Run the scripts from within this location.

> **Note:** This step is critical because the file paths inside the Python scripts are hardcoded to match the environment at the time the agent wrote the code. Moving them to the `output` folder ensures the paths resolve correctly.
