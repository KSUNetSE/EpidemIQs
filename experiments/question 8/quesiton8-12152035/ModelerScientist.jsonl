Well‐Mixed (ODE) SIRS Model\\n\\nIn the standard “mass‐action” SIRS model (with U, P, and F representing unaware, posting, and fatigued individuals, respectively, and with U + P + F = 1), the dynamics are given by\\n\\u2003\\u2003dU/dt = ξ F – β U P,\\n\\u2003\\u2003dP/dt = β U P – γ P,\\n\\u2003\\u2003dF/dt = γ P – ξ F.\\nBecause there is a conservation law, the system is effectively two‐dimensional. One may show that there is an “infection‐free” equilibrium and, for β sufficiently large, an endemic equilibrium. Linearizing around the endemic equilibrium, one finds that the eigenvalues may be complex so that the approach to equilibrium is oscillatory (i.e. the trajectories spiral into the fixed point). However, it is important to stress that these oscillations are damped. (In the language of dynamical systems, a Hopf bifurcation—which would create a stable limit cycle—does not occur in the classical SIRS model with constant rates.) \\n\\nThus, in a well‐mixed ODE version the “oscillations” you might observe in P (posting prevalence) are transient – they appear as damped oscillations about the endemic steady state if the eigenvalues are complex. The condition for having complex eigenvalues (i.e. oscillatory transients) can in principle be derived from the linearization, for example by writing the reduced two‐dimensional system in (P, F) (with U = 1 – P – F) and determining when the discriminant of the resulting quadratic characteristic polynomial is negative. However, one never obtains a parameter regime where sustained (limit‐cycle) oscillations occur in the classic SIRS ODE without additional features (such as delays or nonlinear incidence functions).\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\n2. Embedding the Model on a Watts–Strogatz Small‐World Network\\n\\nWhen the model is “embedded” on a Watts–Strogatz network, two changes occur:\\n\\u2003•\\u2003The infection (U → P) reaction no longer involves a well‐mixed average but is now dictated by the contact network. In particular, a U individual becomes P at a rate proportional to the number (or fraction) of its P neighbors.\\n\\u2003•\\u2003The underlying network structure, characterized by a mean degree k and a rewiring probability p, introduces nontrivial spatial correlations and clustering.\\n\\nIn such networks (especially for small p, where the network is “lattice‐like”), local clusters and “patchiness” in the prevalence of P can lead to resonant or delayed effects that sometimes enhance or even “sustain” oscillatory behavior in the aggregated dynamics. (This is because the effective delay and heterogeneity – features known to promote oscillations – are naturally incorporated by the network.) On the other hand, for large p the network is nearly random, and behavior tends toward that of the homogeneous mixing case, with only damped oscillations.\\n\\nThus, while the well‐mixed model generically shows only damped oscillations near the endemic equilibrium, the small‐world network may display more prominent or recurrent oscillatory patterns in P. However, these oscillations are typically “network‐induced” and are sensitive to the structural parameters (k and p); one may see quasi-cycles or sustained asynchronous outbreaks, but these are not predicted by a simple ODE analysis.\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\n3. Analytic Conditions for Oscillations\\n\\nFor the classical well‐mixed ODE system, one can derive the condition under which the linearization around the endemic fixed point has complex eigenvalues. In terms of the parameters β, γ, and ξ the condition will involve a relation that essentially compares the “force of infection” β (and the resulting effective transmission given the available susceptibles) with the recovery γ and “waning immunity” ξ. However, even if the eigenvalues are complex (and you get damped oscillations), there is no parameter regime in the standard SIRS ODE that yields a self‐sustained (limit‐cycle) oscillation. In other words, the oscillations are “transient” and not stable attractors.\\n\\nFor the small‐world network version, the situation is even more complicated. Although one may try to use moment closures or pair approximations to derive approximate “mean‐field” equations, the resulting conditions for oscillations (if they exist) are not as neat or illuminating. There is no simple analytic criterion “in terms of β, γ, ξ, k, p” that guarantees sustained oscillations. In many cases, numerical or simulation studies (or more sophisticated analytical techniques beyond simple linear stability) are required to identify when network structure will lead to persistent oscillatory behavior.\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\nSummary Answer\\n\\n(1) In the well‐mixed (ODE) SIRS model, the endemic state is stable. Although the Jacobian at that fixed point may have complex eigenvalues (producing damped oscillatory transients) for particular values of β, γ, and ξ, the standard constant‐rate SIRS model does not produce sustained (limit‐cycle) oscillations.\\n\\n(2) When the model is embedded on a Watts–Strogatz small‐world network, the finite connectivity and clustering (especially for lower rewiring probabilities p) introduce spatial correlations and effective delays that can make oscillatory behavior more prominent, sometimes leading to recurrent or quasi‐cyclic outbreaks. For large p (almost random networks), the behavior tends to be more like the well‐mixed case.\\n\\n(3) In both cases there is no “simple” analytic condition guaranteeing or ruling out sustained oscillations. In the ODE model one can derive a condition on the parameters for complex (damped) eigenvalues at the endemic equilibrium, but these do not correspond to a Hopf bifurcation and thus do not yield limit cycles. For the network version, the role of k and p makes the analysis even more involved so that no straightforward criteria exist – one must typically resort to either numerical studies or approximations to assess the possibility of persistent oscillations.\\n\\nThis answer reflects our best theoretical understanding of SIRS dynamics in well-mixed and networked (small-world) settings.The basic idea is to “recreate” the SIRS process as an agent‐based or network‐based simulation on a fixed Watts–Strogatz graph and then observe the prevalence of Posting (P) over time, comparing different parameter regimes and network structures.\\n\\nA concise strategy for simulation validation is as follows:\\n\\n1.

Here’s a step-by-step plan, exclusively focusing on the design of the parametric compartmental mechanistic epidemic model for the described scenario (internet viral trend in a social system with SIRS-like dynamics and network structure). I will outline the logic and sequence required to specify all required model ingredients—compartments, transitions, and parameterized rates—without setting values for these parameters or initial conditions.\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-step plan for mechanistic model design**\n\n1. **Identify the Epidemic Process Type and Corresponding Framework**  \n   - Assess the underlying transmission and recovery/loss-of-immunity processes described.  \n   - Recognize that individuals cycle through three main states:  \n     - Unaware (U): Not yet exposed or have forgotten the trend.  \n     - Posting (P): Actively propagating the trend (infectious state).  \n     - Fatigued (F): Have lost interest or become immune, but can forget and re-enter Unaware.  \n   - This marks the scenario as an SIRS-like process but with social contagion semantics—requiring “U→P→F→U” structure.\n\n2. **Define the Model Compartments**\n   - Assign unique compartments to all distinct epidemiological/social states that individuals can occupy.  \n     - Compartment U (Unaware): Susceptible to being influenced/“infected” by posting neighbors.  \n     - Compartment P (Posting): Actively propagating trend; can influence Unaware neighbors; will eventually lose interest.  \n     - Compartment F (Fatigued): No longer participating or spreading; can spontaneously revisit Unaware state due to forgetting.  \n   - The choice of these three compartments is dictated by both the scenario description as well as correspondence with SIRS compartmental structure.\n\n3. **List All Model Transitions and Define Their Inducing States and Parameters**\n   - For a compartmental model, specify—for each transition—  \n     - The source and target compartments  \n     - The mechanism/state that induces the transition  \n     - The parameter controlling the rate of transition  \n   - Transitions here are:  \n     - U → P:  \n       - Induced when Unaware individuals have contact with Posting neighbors  \n       - Occurs at a rate β per U–P link (i.e., per neighbor who is Posting)  \n     - P → F:  \n       - Posting state lost at rate γ due to fatigue (no contact needed, individual property)  \n     - F → U:  \n       - Fatigued individuals forget at intrinsic rate ξ, returning to Unaware (again, individual property)\n   - Express the transitions in formal mechanistic notation referencing the correct inducer state and associated rate parameters.\n\n4. **Specify the Model as a Network-based (Graph-structured) Process**\n   - Explicitly define that the infection (U→P) occurs through contacts on a static graph (here: Watts-Strogatz small-world network):  \n     - Dynamics are local: Each U node’s risk of transition depends on the presence and number of P-neighbors in its adjacency list.  \n     - The other transitions (P→F, F→U) proceed at node-level rates independent of the network.\n   - Make clear that the state of each node is governed by its own compartment and its local neighborhood in the contact network structure.\n\n5. **Summarize Full Compartment-Transition Map with Parameterization**\n   - Enumerate the complete model:  \n     - Compartments: [“U”, “P”, “F”]  \n     - Transition rules:  \n       - “U -(P)-> P” at rate β per U–P link (network-local interaction)  \n       - “P -> F” at rate γ (individual intrinsic event)  \n       - “F -> U” at rate ξ (individual intrinsic event)\n   - Optionally, draft a diagram or explicit dictionary-format of transitions for later formalization in code or equations.\n\n6. **Rationalize and Justify the Model Choices**\n   - Justify the use of SIRS structure: The scenario asks for a process with loss of “immunity” (forgetting) and recovery of susceptibility.  \n   - Argue the selection and meaning of each compartment in social epidemic terms.  \n   - Explain why infection is modeled as a per-link rate, based on the small-world network, while recovery and forgetting are node-intrinsic (standard for SIRS on networks).  \n   - Confirm that no additional compartments (e.g., incubating/exposed, dead/quarantined) are needed per scenario.  \n   - Reaffirm that parameterization is left abstract (β, γ, ξ), per instructions.\n\n7. **Preparation for Analytical and Simulation Implementation**  \n   - Conclude by confirming this model structure is sufficient and maximally expressive for both theoretical (e.g., mean-field or moment-closure equations) and simulation approaches (e.g., agent-based on the Watts-Strogatz network), with all necessary compartments and transitions clearly specified for further implementation.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThis step-by-step plan ensures the mechanistic compartmental model is rigorously specified, with every compartment and transition justified by scenario logic and canonical epidemic modeling practice, mapped precisely onto the required network structure and with clear parametric transitions.

We model this process using an SIRS-like framework (specifically, U→P→F→U), suitable for contagion with loss of immunity. The process unfolds over a Watts-Strogatz static 'Small-World' contact network with N nodes, average degree k, and rewiring probability p. The dynamics are: U→P at rate β per contact with P-neighbors, P→F at rate γ (fatigue), F→U at rate ξ (forgetting); all transitions are stochastic. According to literature and theory, transition rate homogeneity (narrow distributions for infectious/fatigue times), moderate network rewiring (intermediate p), and sufficiently strong β collectively allow network-induced synchronization of Posting waves. These conditions may yield persistent oscillations (limit cycles) in the Posting population, as opposed to the endemic equilibrium always reached in the well-mixed ODE model (where oscillations are always damped). Simulation experiments should use a Watts-Strogatz network (N ≈ 1000–10000, k ≈ 6–12, p ≈ 0.05–0.2), initial small fraction of P, varied rates β, γ, and ξ.

Well‐Mixed (ODE) SIRS Model\\n\\nIn the standard “mass‐action” SIRS model (with U, P, and F representing unaware, posting, and fatigued individuals, respectively, and with U + P + F = 1), the dynamics are given by\\n\\u2003\\u2003dU/dt = ξ F – β U P,\\n\\u2003\\u2003dP/dt = β U P – γ P,\\n\\u2003\\u2003dF/dt = γ P – ξ F.\\nBecause there is a conservation law, the system is effectively two‐dimensional. One may show that there is an “infection‐free” equilibrium and, for β sufficiently large, an endemic equilibrium. Linearizing around the endemic equilibrium, one finds that the eigenvalues may be complex so that the approach to equilibrium is oscillatory (i.e. the trajectories spiral into the fixed point). However, it is important to stress that these oscillations are damped. (In the language of dynamical systems, a Hopf bifurcation—which would create a stable limit cycle—does not occur in the classical SIRS model with constant rates.) \\n\\nThus, in a well‐mixed ODE version the “oscillations” you might observe in P (posting prevalence) are transient – they appear as damped oscillations about the endemic steady state if the eigenvalues are complex. The condition for having complex eigenvalues (i.e. oscillatory transients) can in principle be derived from the linearization, for example by writing the reduced two‐dimensional system in (P, F) (with U = 1 – P – F) and determining when the discriminant of the resulting quadratic characteristic polynomial is negative. However, one never obtains a parameter regime where sustained (limit‐cycle) oscillations occur in the classic SIRS ODE without additional features (such as delays or nonlinear incidence functions).\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\n2. Embedding the Model on a Watts–Strogatz Small‐World Network\\n\\nWhen the model is “embedded” on a Watts–Strogatz network, two changes occur:\\n\\u2003•\\u2003The infection (U → P) reaction no longer involves a well‐mixed average but is now dictated by the contact network. In particular, a U individual becomes P at a rate proportional to the number (or fraction) of its P neighbors.\\n\\u2003•\\u2003The underlying network structure, characterized by a mean degree k and a rewiring probability p, introduces nontrivial spatial correlations and clustering.\\n\\nIn such networks (especially for small p, where the network is “lattice‐like”), local clusters and “patchiness” in the prevalence of P can lead to resonant or delayed effects that sometimes enhance or even “sustain” oscillatory behavior in the aggregated dynamics. (This is because the effective delay and heterogeneity – features known to promote oscillations – are naturally incorporated by the network.) On the other hand, for large p the network is nearly random, and behavior tends toward that of the homogeneous mixing case, with only damped oscillations.\\n\\nThus, while the well‐mixed model generically shows only damped oscillations near the endemic equilibrium, the small‐world network may display more prominent or recurrent oscillatory patterns in P. However, these oscillations are typically “network‐induced” and are sensitive to the structural parameters (k and p); one may see quasi-cycles or sustained asynchronous outbreaks, but these are not predicted by a simple ODE analysis.\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\n3. Analytic Conditions for Oscillations\\n\\nFor the classical well‐mixed ODE system, one can derive the condition under which the linearization around the endemic fixed point has complex eigenvalues. In terms of the parameters β, γ, and ξ the condition will involve a relation that essentially compares the “force of infection” β (and the resulting effective transmission given the available susceptibles) with the recovery γ and “waning immunity” ξ. However, even if the eigenvalues are complex (and you get damped oscillations), there is no parameter regime in the standard SIRS ODE that yields a self‐sustained (limit‐cycle) oscillation. In other words, the oscillations are “transient” and not stable attractors.\\n\\nFor the small‐world network version, the situation is even more complicated. Although one may try to use moment closures or pair approximations to derive approximate “mean‐field” equations, the resulting conditions for oscillations (if they exist) are not as neat or illuminating. There is no simple analytic criterion “in terms of β, γ, ξ, k, p” that guarantees sustained oscillations. In many cases, numerical or simulation studies (or more sophisticated analytical techniques beyond simple linear stability) are required to identify when network structure will lead to persistent oscillatory behavior.\\n\\n──────────────────────────────\\nSummary Answer\\n\\n(1) In the well‐mixed (ODE) SIRS model, the endemic state is stable. Although the Jacobian at that fixed point may have complex eigenvalues (producing damped oscillatory transients) for particular values of β, γ, and ξ, the standard constant‐rate SIRS model does not produce sustained (limit‐cycle) oscillations.\\n\\n(2) When the model is embedded on a Watts–Strogatz small‐world network, the finite connectivity and clustering (especially for lower rewiring probabilities p) introduce spatial correlations and effective delays that can make oscillatory behavior more prominent, sometimes leading to recurrent or quasi‐cyclic outbreaks. For large p (almost random networks), the behavior tends to be more like the well‐mixed case.\\n\\n(3) In both cases there is no “simple” analytic condition guaranteeing or ruling out sustained oscillations. In the ODE model one can derive a condition on the parameters for complex (damped) eigenvalues at the endemic equilibrium, but these do not correspond to a Hopf bifurcation and thus do not yield limit cycles. For the network version, the role of k and p makes the analysis even more involved so that no straightforward criteria exist – one must typically resort to either numerical studies or approximations to assess the possibility of persistent oscillations.\\n\\nThis answer reflects our best theoretical understanding of SIRS dynamics in well-mixed and networked (small-world) settings.The basic idea is to “recreate” the SIRS process as an agent‐based or network‐based simulation on a fixed Watts–Strogatz graph and then observe the prevalence of Posting (P) over time, comparing different parameter regimes and network structures.\\n\\nA concise strategy for simulation validation is as follows:\\n\\n1.
