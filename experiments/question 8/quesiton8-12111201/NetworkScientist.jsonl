Here’s a detailed, chain-of-thought plan to design and construct the network to best represent the population structure, focusing exclusively on the network structure for the SIRS-like internet trend model described above:\n\nStep 1: Identify Required Network Type and Parameters  \n • The discovery phase information indicates that a static Watts–Strogatz small-world network is to be used.  \n • Required properties:  \n  – Number of nodes N = 1000  \n  – Each node to have mean degree k = 10  \n  – Rewiring probability p = 0.05  \n • No layering or multiplex required; single, undirected graph.\n\nStep 2: Choose Network Library and Data Structure  \n • Use NetworkX, which provides robust implementations of Watts–Strogatz graphs.  \n • Network will be constructed as a networkx.Graph object.  \n • Later, for simulations, the network will be saved as a SciPy sparse matrix in .npz format for efficiency.\n\nStep 3: Construct the Watts–Strogatz Network  \n • Use networkx.watts_strogatz_graph(n=1000, k=10, p=0.05) to generate the graph.  \n • This will create a ring lattice (each node with k/2 neighbors on each side) and then rewire edges with probability p.  \n • Ensure no self-loops or multi-edges; Watts–Strogatz in NetworkX maintains these constraints.\n\nStep 4: Validate and Adjust Network Properties  \n • After network creation, calculate key metrics to ensure they reflect requirements:  \n  – Mean degree <k>: Confirm that the average degree is ≈10.  \n  – Second moment <k²>: Compute as it characterizes transmission heterogeneity.  \n  – Global clustering coefficient: Should be high, typical of a small-world.  \n  – Average shortest path length: Should be small (“small world effect”).  \n • If degree distribution or clustering is far from target, regenerate or fine-tune parameters (e.g., ensure k is even, check for connectivity).\n\nStep 5: Prepare for Simulation — Export Network  \n • Save the adjacency matrix of the network in sparse matrix .npz format in the indicated output directory.  \n • This ensures the network can be reloaded efficiently for simulation phases.\n\nStep 6: Diagnostic Visualization  \n • Plot degree distribution histogram to visually confirm narrow bell-like distribution (as expected for Watts–Strogatz network).  \n • Plot clustering coefficient distribution across nodes to check for high clustering.  \n • Optionally, visualize global/mean values in captioned barplots or summary tables if relevant for documentation.\n\nStep 7: Initial Node States Not Embedded in Network  \n • Initial states of nodes (Unaware, Posting, Fatigued) are handled externally by the simulation, not stored as attributes in the network structure.
