Each user is represented as a node, and edges denote potential exposure to the trend (contact). Users cycle through three states: Unaware (U), Posting (P), and Fatigued (F). Transitions are: U→P at rate β=0.8/day per contact with a Posting neighbor (propagating the trend), P→F at rate γ=0.3/day (becoming fatigued with the trend), and F→U at rate ξ=0.1/day (eventual forgetting and renewed susceptibility). The network contains N=1000 nodes, each initialized with mean degree k=10 and rewiring probability p=0.05 (typical small-world parameters), reflecting a realistic social cluster structure with a few shortcuts. At t=0, 1% of the users are randomly assigned to the Posting state, with the rest Unaware and none Fatigued. This experiment aims to investigate whether the inclusion of forgetting (F→U) induces stable, recurring waves of Posting activity (oscillations) or whether the activity settles to a steady-state persistent level.\\n\\nThe mechanistic model is SIRS (Unaware–Posting–Fatigued–Unaware cycle) on a Watts–Strogatz network.

In fact, in the simplest (mean‐field) formulation the model has an endemic steady state that is (locally) stable – although in many cases the approach to this equilibrium is by damped oscillations. In order for true, self‐sustained (limit‐cycle) oscillations to exist a Hopf bifurcation must occur. (In network studies “small‐world” effects may further complicate matters, but the basic “SIRS” mechanism remains the same.) \\n\\nHere is one way to see the situation:\\n\\n1. Model formulation\\n\\nOne may write a set of differential equations for the fractions U (Unaware), P (Posting), and F (Fatigued) which satisfy U + P + F = 1. For example, one may take\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003dU/dt = ξ F − β U φ(P)  \\n\\u2003\\u2003dP/dt = β U φ(P) − γ P  \\n\\u2003\\u2003dF/dt = γ P − ξ F\\n\\nwhere φ(P) represents an “effective contact” term. In the simplest case φ(P) may be chosen proportional to P (with an appropriate rescaling) so that the incidence is bilinear. (In structured networks the effective mixing may differ, but the “mean‐field stability” analysis follows similarly.) \\n\\n2. Steady state and its linearization\\n\\nAssuming that contact mixing is given by βU·P, the non‐trivial endemic equilibrium (ignoring the trivial P = 0 state) is found by setting\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003β U* P* = γP*\\u2003⟹\\u2003U* = γ/β\\u2003\\u2003(with the proper adjustment if one uses a conservation relation)\\n\\u2003\\u2003F* = (γ/ξ) P* \\n\\nWriting U = 1 – P – F and solving one finds, for instance, \\n\\u2003\\u2003P* = (1 – γ/β)/(1 + γ/ξ).\\n\\nA standard linearization about this endemic state then leads to a Jacobian matrix (after eliminating the redundant equation). One obtains a 2×2 system (with the variables taken to be P and F, say) with a characteristic polynomial of the form\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003λ² + (β P* + ξ) λ + β P*(ξ+γ) = 0.\\n\\nThus the eigenvalues are\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003λ = –½(β P* + ξ) ± ½√[(β P* + ξ)² – 4βP*(ξ+γ)].\\n\\nOscillatory (i.e. complex) eigenvalues will occur when the discriminant is negative, namely when\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003(β P* + ξ)² < 4β P*(ξ+γ).\\n\\nSo even if the eigenvalues are complex (yielding damped oscillations), the real parts are negative and the system eventually approaches the steady state. Only at the Hopf bifurcation, when the real part passes through zero, can one hope to see self‐sustained oscillations (a limit cycle).\\n\\n3. What does this mean?\\n\\nIn our model, the “forgetting” (F→U) process does not by itself “force” the system to oscillate forever. Instead, for generic parameter choices (typical values of β, γ, and ξ) one finds that the system relaxes to an endemic equilibrium, possibly by damped oscillations. Only if the parameters are tuned such that\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003(βP* + ξ)² < 4βP*(ξ+γ)\\n\\n(for example, if the spread rate β is sufficiently high and the rates of “fatigue” γ and “forgetting” ξ are chosen so that the delayed feedback is strong enough) does the endemic state become unstable via a Hopf bifurcation and self‐sustained oscillations (periodic “waves”) occur. In many real-world settings (and in many analytical treatments of the standard SIRS model) the oscillations are damped rather than persistent.\\n\\n4. Conclusion\\n\\nThus, to answer directly: In a SIRS-type model on a small-world network with transitions U → P (at rate β per infectious contact), P → F (at rate γ) and F → U (at rate ξ), the inclusion of the F→U cycle by itself does not generically yield stable periodic oscillations in the Posting population. Rather, one typically obtains an endemic steady state, reached perhaps after transient (damped) oscillations. Only if the parameters happen to satisfy conditions akin to\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003(β P* + ξ)² < 4β P*(ξ+γ)\\u2003\\u2003with\\u2003P* = (1 – γ/β)/(1 + γ/ξ)\\n\\n(which essentially is a Hopf bifurcation condition) will one observe self‐sustained periodic oscillations (“waves”). \\n\\nIn practice, while the basic SIRS dynamics tend to yield a fixed endemic state, more complicated features (such as network heterogeneity, time delays or additional nonlinearities) may lead to sustained epidemics waves.To validate the analytical prediction using simulations on static networks, you can build an agent‐based epidemic mechanistic model on a small‐world network (for example, generated via the Watts–Strogatz algorithm). Here's a concise plan:\\n\\n1. Construct a network where each node represents a user, and edges represent potential transmission contacts. Use small‐world topology parameters (rewiring probability, average degree, etc.) to capture clustering and short paths.\\n\\n2. Implement the SIRS dynamics by assigning each node one of the states U, P, or F. Use the following stochastic rules:\\n\\u2003\\u2003• A U node becomes P with probability roughly β per contact with a P node.\\n\\u2003\\u2003• A P node transitions to F at rate γ.\\n\\u2003\\u2003• An F node reverts to U at rate ξ.\\n\\n3. Run the simulation over many time steps and track the time series of the fraction of Posting (P) nodes. By appropriately choosing β, γ, and ξ (for instance, tuning β high relative to γ and ξ to cross the Hopf bifurcation threshold), you can observe either damped oscillations converging to a steady endemic level or sustained oscillations (“waves”).\\n\\n4. Validate by comparing the simulation time series' behavior with the stability analysis:\\n\\u2003\\u2003• Look for damped oscillations or sustained periodic oscillations when the effective condition \\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003(βP* + ξ)² < 4βP*(ξ + γ)\\n\\u2003\\u2003is nearly met.\\n\\u2003\\u2003• Record and statistically analyze the periods and amplitudes of the oscillations against predictions from the mean‐field linearization.\\n\\nThis approach—combining network generation, state‐transition rules, and time series analysis—allows you to validate whether, under the given parameter conditions, the networked epidemic model converges to a steady state or exhibits periodic epidemic waves.In homogeneous (mean‐field) SIRS models the averaging over the whole population “washes out” spatial or topological differences, so that the endemic fixed point is approached uniformly—perhaps with damped oscillations. By contrast, small‐world networks introduce two key ingredients that can destabilize this homogeneous behavior and allow persistent oscillations:\\n\\n1.\\u2003Local Clustering and Reinforcement:\\n\\u2003• In a clustered network, groups of nodes are tightly connected. An outbreak in such a cluster can be highly synchronized locally, creating a “pacemaker” region where the infection peak is quite pronounced.\\n\\u2003• Once a local outbreak fades (e.g., most nodes become fatigued), the nearby cluster takes longer to “recover” because the individuals’ state transitions (from F back to U) are delayed by local reinfections. This delay creates an effective phase lag relative to neighboring clusters.\\n\\n2.\\u2003Short Paths and Heterogeneity:\\n\\u2003• The small-world property (short average path lengths via a few long-range connections) allows these localized clusters to interact asynchronously. In other words, while one region is near its peak outbreak, another may be in its recovery phase.\\n\\u2003• Such phase differences can lead to a “relay” effect. The infection can be re-seeded from a cluster that is still in the Posting phase into a neighboring cluster that has just become susceptible. This continuous reactivation across the network prevents the complete damping out of oscillations.\\n\\u2003• Heterogeneity in local connectivity (e.g., variations in node degree) means that some nodes act as hubs or “super-spreaders” that further reinforce these asynchronous local dynamics.\\n\\nMathematically, when one moves from a well-mixed model (with a 3-dimensional system describing U, P, F) to formulations that include network structure (e.g., via pair approximations or metapopulation models), additional terms capture local correlations and delays. These additional terms can introduce:\\n\\n\\u2003– Delay-differential effects or effective time lags in the interaction terms,\\n\\u2003– Phase differences between coupled subpopulations,\\n\\u2003– Conditions under which a Hopf bifurcation can occur at the network (or mesoscale) level even if the mean‐field eigenvalues are simply damped oscillations.\\n\\nFor instance, if one develops a pair-approximation model, the equations for the densities of U-P or P-P links evolve nonlinearly, and a linear stability analysis may reveal an instability (or a Hopf bifurcation) driven not just by the local reaction rates (β, γ, ξ) but also by the clustering coefficient and distribution of short paths in the network. In agent-based simulations, this manifests as sustained epidemic waves where regions of high Posting activity “travel” across the network, a feature that is absent when every node interacts equally with every other node.\\n\\nIn summary, the persistent oscillations in SIRS dynamics on small-world networks arise because:\\n\\u2003– Clustering and local reinforcement create localized pacemakers with phase-lagged dynamics,\\n\\u2003– Short-cuts and network heterogeneity allow asynchronous regions to effectively “pump” the infection back into recovering areas,\\nand these effects can be captured analytically by extending mean-field models to include correlations or via agent-based simulations that explicitly model network topology.You can validate the effect of network structure on sustained oscillations by constructing an agent‐based epidemic model on a static small-world network. Here’s a concise strategy:\\n\\n1. Build a static network (e.g., using Watts–Strogatz) that exhibits high clustering and short path lengths.\\n\\n2. Implement SIRS dynamics at the node level:\\n\\u2003• Each node cycles through Unaware (U) → Posting (P) → Fatigued (F) with transitions at rates β, γ, and ξ, respectively.\\n\\u2003• Allow infection only along the network edges, so local clustering causes nearby nodes to synchronize their transitions.\\n\\n3. Run the simulation over time and track the time series of P nodes. Look for persistent, sustained oscillations—as opposed to the damped ones predicted by homogeneous (mean‐field) models. Oscillations may manifest as localized “pacemaker” behavior and phase lags between clusters.\\n\\n4. Validate the simulation by comparing statistical features (such as frequency and amplitude of oscillations) with extended analytical models (for instance, pair approximation models) that include clustering and local interactions.\\n\\nThis approach shows that spatial heterogeneity, local reinforcement, and asynchronous interactions among clusters can sustain epidemic waves even where mean‐field theory predicts only damped oscillatory decay to an equilibrium.Below is a concise answer that summarizes both literature‐based guidelines (where available) and reasonable modeling assumptions:\\n\\n1. In many published SIRS-like models—whether for classical epidemics or digital/social contagions—there are few “hard” empirical values because the parameters depend on the specific context and data. For viral internet trends, some studies have adopted plausible ranges such as:\\n\\u2003• Posting/infection rate β: roughly 0.1–1.0 per day (or per appropriate time unit), assuming that when someone sees the trend, they may “post” or propagate it rapidly.\\n\\u2003• Fatigue rate γ: roughly 0.1–0.5 per day, representing the relatively fast transition from active participation to becoming “tired” of the trend.\\n\\u2003• Forgetting rate ξ: roughly 0.01–0.1 per day, reflecting that “forgetting” or loss of immunity (i.e., being susceptible to a new viral hit) often takes longer than the immediate excitement or fatigue phases.\\n\\n2. These ranges (or ratios) capture the idea that digital contagions are fast in “infection” (posting) and fatigue but slower in forgetting—so a typical choice is β > γ ≫ ξ. However, if the time unit is chosen so that events occur on an hourly basis, then the numerical values would be rescaled appropriately.\\n\\n3. The relative timescales are crucial:\\n\\u2003• If forgetting (ξ) is very slow relative to fatigue (γ), then once users get tired, they stay out of the susceptible pool for a long time. This tends to damp oscillations, pushing the system toward a steady state.\\n\\u2003• In contrast, if ξ is relatively fast (i.e. forgetting happens quickly so that users become vulnerable again), then the pool of susceptibles can be readily reloaded. In that case, together with a high posting rate (β) and a moderate fatigue rate (γ), there is a larger chance of sustained oscillations under certain conditions (e.g., when the effective local dynamics meet criteria akin to the Hopf bifurcation condition derived in a pair approximation).\\n\\n4. Consequently, simulations of these models on small-world networks have sometimes chosen parameter sets where β is high and ξ is not too small compared to γ (for instance, β ≈ 0.8 per day, γ ≈ 0.3 per day, and ξ ≈ 0.1 per day) to explore oscillatory regimes. On the other hand, if ξ is very slow (say, 0.01 per day), the recovery of susceptibles is delayed so much that the system will tend toward a stable steady state after an outbreak.\\n\\n5. In summary, while precise empirical values may be lacking for digital trends, many published studies use these rough ranges. The likelihood of sustained oscillations increases when the timescale for forgetting (ξ) is not too long relative to the posting (β) and fatigue (γ) rates—this ensures that enough individuals return to the susceptible pool in time to “reignite” the infection in other local clusters. Simulation studies validate this by showing that when the ratio ξ/γ is high enough (i.e. users “forget” quickly relative to how fast they become fatigued), the system can support persistent epidemic waves even in a network with small-world properties.\\n\\nThis parameter guidance is derived both from analogies with disease models and from modeling practices reported in literature on social contagion and network-based SIRS dynamics.A straightforward way to validate these assumptions is to construct an agent‐based SIRS simulation on a static small‐world network. Here’s a concise validation plan:\\n\\n1. Build a small‐world network (for instance, using a Watts–Strogatz model) that provides high clustering with some long‐range shortcuts.\\n\\n2. Implement node-level SIRS dynamics with transitions:\\n\\u2003• U → P triggered at rate β based on contacts with Posting (P) neighbors.\\n\\u2003• P → F occurring at rate γ.\\n\\u2003• F → U happening at rate ξ.\\n\\n3. Use parameter values or reasonable assumptions from literature (e.g., β ≈ 0.8, γ ≈ 0.3, and ξ ≈ 0.1 per day) or adjust these to reflect the desired timescales. In digital trends, posting/infection is fast (higher β), fatigue occurs moderately (γ), and forgetting may be slower—but if ξ is not too slow, it can reload the susceptible pool to trigger renewed activity.\\n\\n4. Run the simulation over time and record the time series for the fractions of U, P, and F nodes. In a homogeneous model you would expect damped oscillations toward a steady state; however, with small‐world features (local reinforcements, phase lags among clusters), you may observe persistent oscillations or epidemic waves.\\n\\n5. Compare the observed dynamics and statistical characteristics (frequency, amplitude) with extended analytical models (for instance, pair approximation models that include clustering effects) to confirm that network heterogeneity and interaction delays enable sustained oscillations even when the mean‐field model predicts damping.\\n\\nUsing this simulation-based approach over static networks (with proper parameter exploration) validates how realistic network topology can shift the dynamics from convergence to a steady state toward persistent, oscillatory behavior.Based on both the mean-field analysis and the parameter values provided, one would expect that the Posting population (P) exhibits an initial outbreak with damped oscillations that eventually settle to a steady endemic state rather than showing persistent, self-sustained epidemic waves.\\n\\nHere’s the reasoning:\\n\\n• In a standard SIRS formulation, using the rates β=0.8, γ=0.3, and ξ=0.1, one finds a nontrivial endemic equilibrium (for instance, U*≈γ/β≈0.375 and P* of roughly 0.16). Performing a linear stability analysis yields complex eigenvalues with negative real parts under these parameter regimes. In particular, checking a Hopf-condition-like inequality (e.g., (βP*+ξ)² < 4βP*(ξ+γ)), the values indicate that while oscillatory modes (i.e. complex eigenvalues) are present, these are damped.\\n\\n• When implemented on a Watts–Strogatz small-world network with N=1000 nodes, mean degree k=10, and a moderate rewiring probability (p=0.05), the spatial heterogeneity and local clustering can sometimes sustain localized wave-like behavior. However, if the underlying rate parameters still yield a stable (endemic) fixed point in the mean-field limit, any oscillations tend to be transient — that is, damped oscillations that converge to the steady state.\\n\\n• With only 1% of nodes initially Posting, one typically observes an outbreak that overshoots, and then the Posting fraction oscillates around a mean value in a decaying fashion before finally stabilizing at the endemic level dictated by the balance of new postings, fatigue, and forgetting.\\n\\nThus, with these values there is neither strong enough feedback nor sufficiently rapid forgetting relative to posting and fatigue to produce continuous, self-sustained periodic oscillations. Instead, the system is expected to show damped oscillations that converge to a steady endemic state, rather than extinction or sustained epidemic waves.To validate this scenario, you can implement an agent‐based SIRS simulation on a static Watts–Strogatz network with N=1000, mean degree k=10, and rewiring probability p=0.05 using the given rate parameters (β=0.8/day, γ=0.3/day, ξ=0.1/day) with 1% initially Posting. In the simulation:\\n\\n1. Build the network topology, ensuring high clustering with a few long-range shortcuts.\\n2. Implement stochastic SIRS transitions at the node level that follow U → P (based on contact with P neighbors), P → F, and F → U transitions at the respective rates.\\n3. Run the simulation long enough to record the time series of the Posting compartment (P).\\n\\nBased on prior analysis, you should observe an initial outbreak with damped oscillations in P that eventually converge to an endemic steady state rather than sustained oscillations. Comparing the simulation output to the expected behavior (i.e., transient oscillations settling into a steady level) will confirm the analytical prediction for these parameter values.\")\n we have created the network with Network specification:\n {'network_details': 'Network Structure: Watts–Strogatz small-world network with N=1000 nodes, each node having mean degree k=10 and rewiring probability p=0.05.

The cyclical dynamics of the viral internet trend fit a classic SIRS epidemiological framework, requiring three mutually exclusive, exhaustive compartments: U (Unaware), P (Posting), and F (Fatigued). This mapping is natural: U corresponds to those susceptible/unexposed, P to those currently propagating the trend, and F to those temporarily 'immune'/fatigued.\\n\\n2. Only three biological/social processes must be mechanistically represented: (a) exposure-driven transition from U to P via contact with Posting neighbors ('network-induced infection'), (b) spontaneous loss of posting enthusiasm from P to F ('fatigue'), and (c) return to U from F via forgetting ('waning fatigue/immunity'). There are no other plausible transitions for this setting.\\n\\n3. These are formalized as:\\n- U -(P)-> P: U to P at rate beta per edge contact with P (network-driven, capturing realistic propagation).\\n- P -> F: Spontaneous switching to fatigue at a constant node-level rate gamma (network-independent).\\n- F -> U: Spontaneous 'forgetting'/return to unaware at constant rate xi, network-independent.\\n\\n4. The dynamic contact structure is explicitly realized via a (static) Watts–Strogatz small-world graph (not well-mixed), enforcing realistic local clustering and occasional shortcuts.

The description also notes random assignment, in line with the experiment's intent.\n   - No additional groupings or stratifications are required for this experiment as described.\n\n4. **Reproducibility and Documentation:**\n   - All calculations (including diagnostic reproduction number) are provided for transparency, and the script file is both saved and clearly labeled for traceability.\n   - Reasoning ensures that simulation users or reviewers can track choices back to both input data and accepted practice.\n\n5. **Completeness:**\n   - No compartment/transition naming or structure errors are present.\n   - No mismatches between model, network, scenario aims, or technical implementation are observed.\n   - The output provides all information (rates, initial state, justification, and interpretation) needed for robust simulation and secondary review.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe parameterization and initial condition are accurate, transparent, and scenario-appropriate, with all necessary justifications and error checks provided.
