Here a network model is presented as an aid in understanding the role of social behavior and heterogeneous connectivity in determining the spatio-temporal patterns of disease dynamics. We explore the controversial origins of long-term recurrent oscillations believed to be characteristic to diseases that have a period of temporary immunity after infection. In particular, we focus on sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, where this controversy is currently under review. Although temporary immunity plays a key role, it is found that in realistic small-world networks, the social and sexual behavior of individuals also has great influence in generating long-term cycles. The model generates circular waves of infection with unusual spatial dynamics that depend on focal areas that act as pacemakers in the population. Eradication of the disease can be efficiently achieved by eliminating the pacemakers with a targeted vaccination scheme. A simple difference equation model is derived, that captures the infection dynamics of the network model and gives insights into their origins and their eradication through vaccination.",

                    "abstract": "A discrete-time deterministic epidemic model is proposed to better understand the contagious dynamics and the behaviour observed in the incidence of real infectious diseases. For this purpose, we analyse a SIRS model both in a random-mixing approach and in a small-world network formulation. The models include the basic parameters that characterize an epidemic: infection and recovery times, as well as mechanisms of contagion. Depending on the parameters, the random-mixing model has different types of behaviour of an epidemic: pathogen extinction; endemic infection; sustained oscillations and dynamic extinction. Spatial effects are included in our network-based approach, where each individual of a population is represented by a node of a small-world network. Our network-based approach includes rewiring connections to account for time-varying network structure, a consequence of the natural response to the emergence of an epidemic (e.g. avoiding contacts with infected individuals). Random and adaptive rewiring conditions are analysed and numerical simulation are made. A comparison of model predictions with the actual effects of COVID-19 infection on population that occurred in Italy and France is produced. Results of the time series of infected people show that our adaptive evolving networks represent effective strategies able to decrease the epidemic spreading.",
