Coverage of User Request: \n- The generated response directly addresses the user's query: it outlines a mechanistic, simulation-based comparison between epidemic dynamics on a small-world network versus a random network, with both networks sharing the same average degree. \n- The response is explicit about investigating both the speed of the infection wavefront and peak prevalence as requested.\n- It also mechanistically addresses whether redundant connections in the clustered network accelerate or decelerate transition from S to I, providing both theory and a simulation approach.\n\n2.
