No specific pathogen is selected; the question is generic for directly transmitted, non-latent diseases (e.g., influenza-like), using the SIR compartmental structure. Model parameters are chosen for canonical/general illustration: beta (β, transmission rate) ~0.3/day, gamma (γ, recovery rate) ~0.1/day, giving R0 = β/γ = 3. \n\nAnalytically (in the well-mixed SIR model):\n- If the basic reproduction number R0 ≤ 1, the epidemic is stifled early—the number of infectives (I) declines before susceptibles (S) are significantly depleted. The 'chain breaks' due to the inability of infectives to replenish themselves via transmission, even though many susceptibles remain.\n- If R0 > 1, the epidemic peaks when S drops to S_c = γN/β, at which point dI/dt = 0 and the effective reproduction number falls below unity. I then declines and the epidemic dies out. However, not all susceptibles are exhausted; the process 'burns out', leaving a significant S(∞), determined by the final size equation: ln(S(∞)/S(0)) = -R0 * (1 - S(∞)/N). \n\nOn static networks (e.g., Erdős-Rényi or scale-free):\n- Epidemic thresholds depend on the network's percolation properties and topology. For ER networks with mean degree ⟨k⟩, the condition for a major outbreak is T⟨k⟩ > 1, where T is the per-edge transmission probability. For scale-free networks with diverging second moment, threshold vanishes for large N, so even small T can lead to outbreaks.
