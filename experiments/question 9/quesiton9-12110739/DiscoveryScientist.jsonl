Two network topologies are compared: (1) a 'diversified' topology, with each bank (node) holding many interbank exposures of small size (modeled as an Erdős–Rényi (ER) random network, high average degree), and (2) a 'concentrated' topology, with each bank connected to a few partners but with large exposures (modeled as a Barabási–Albert (BA) or core-periphery network, low average degree, heterogeneous structure). Each bank is assigned fixed total interbank exposure E and a capital buffer B, so the default threshold φ = B/E. Exposures are distributed equally among each bank's k partners (weight per link = E/k). A bank defaults if the fraction m/k of its defaulted neighbors meets or exceeds φ. Distress is introduced via an initial shock affecting either random nodes or targeted (systemic/high-degree) nodes. The process iterates in discrete time: at each step, non-defaulted banks with sufficient defaulted neighbors (m/k ≥ φ) themselves default. The simulation proceeds until no new defaults occur. Cascade size (total fraction of defaulted banks) and speed (convergence time) are measured under both topologies for random and targeted shocks, and across a range of φ.\n\nMechanistic model: SI-like threshold process on static network; default occurs at m/k ≥ φ (φ = buffer/exposure). In diversified networks, high k (many small exposures) makes random cascades less likely but allows rapid spread if thresholds are crossed.
