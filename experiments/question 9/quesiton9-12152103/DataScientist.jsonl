Identify the Core Simulation Questions\\n- We want to simulate how a liquidity crisis propagates on a core-periphery banking network using the S-D-L (Solvent-Distressed-Liquidated) compartmental dynamics.\\n- We are to compare the time-evolution, peak number, and time-to-peak of Distressed banks under two initial seeding scenarios:\\n   - (a) Crisis starts in a single high-degree **core** node\\n   - (b) Crisis starts in a single random **periphery** node\\n\\n## 2. Define Baseline Scenarios for Comparison\\n### Model Structure\\n- **Compartments**: [\"S\", \"D\", \"L\"]\\n- **Transitions**:\\n    - S -(D)-> D (infectious edge transmission, rate β=0.3)\\n    - D -> L (node transition, rate γ=0.5)\\n\\n### Network\\n- Provided as a pre-generated, validated static network (.npz, CSR sparse matrix).\\n- Core = 20 nodes, Periphery = 80 nodes.\\n- The scenario descriptions and diagnostics confirm this network matches the intended structure, so **no new network construction is needed**.\\n\\n### Initial Conditions\\n- Scenario 1 (core-seeded): One (the highest degree) core node is \"D\", rest are \"S\".\\n- Scenario 2 (periphery-seeded): One random periphery node is \"D\", rest are \"S\".\\n\\n### Parameters\\n- β = 0.3 (spread rate)\\n- γ = 0.5 (liquidation rate)\\n- Network size: N = 100 nodes\\n\\n### Repetitions\\n- Multiple stochastic realizations (e.g., 1000 runs) for each scenario are required to capture variability and estimate confidence intervals.\\n\\n## 3. Setup with FastGEMF\\n### Why FastGEMF?\\n- FastGEMF is designed for compartmental mechanistic models over static networks, exactly fitting our S-D-L CTMC setup.\\n- It supports edge-induced and node transitions, as required here.\\n\\n### Step-wise Plan\\n#### Step 1. Load Network\\n- Load the provided .npz (CSR matrix) network, ensuring core/periphery node indices are preserved as needed.\\n- (If the node labels mapping is needed, reconstruct core/periphery indices from supplied network generation script or logic—but with N=100, structure likely obvious: nodes 0:19=core, 20:99=periphery.)\\n\\n#### Step 2. Specify Compartments & Transitions in FastGEMF\\n- Define the three compartments.\\n- Add an edge-induced transition: S → D, induced by neighbor D, via \"contact_network_layer\".\\n- Add a node transition: D → L, parameter γ.\\n\\n#### Step 3. Encapsulate Model Parameters\\n- β=0.3 and γ=0.5 via `add_parameter`.\\n\\n#### Step 4. Prepare Initial Conditions\\n- For **Scenario 1**: \\n   - Identify highest-degree core node (among nodes 0–19, or as per structure).\\n   - Set its state as \"D\", all others as \"S\", none as \"L\" (encode via \"exact\" method using X0 array).\\n- For **Scenario 2**:\\n   - Randomly pick a node among periphery indices (20–99).\\n   - Set it as \"D\", others as \"S\" (again, define X0 accordingly).\\n\\n#### Step 5. Simulation Repetitions & Time Horizon\\n- Set a sufficiently high number of simulations (e.g., nsim=1000) to derive stable statistics (mean, confidence intervals).\\n- Set a simulation stop time (e.g., 100 units; ensure long enough for all crises to terminate).\\n\\n#### Step 6. Run Simulations & Aggregate Results\\n- For each scenario:\\n   - Run all realizations using FastGEMF\\'s Simulation object.\\n   - Extract: \\n      - Time series of compartment counts for \"D\"\\n      - Peak \"D\" (maximum prevalence) and time to peak for each run\\n   - Save: \\n      - Full time series of average and bound (e.g., 90% CI) for \"D\"\\n      - Plots (D(t), CI bands/time, per scenario)\\n\\n#### Step 7. Comparative Analysis Preparation\\n- (This is for downstream analysis, not part of simulation phase per se:)\\n   - Ensure export of relevant statistics to allow per-scenario calculation of:\\n     - Mean (and quantiles) of Distressed peak size\\n     - Mean (and quantiles) of time-to-peak D\\n\\n## 4. Incorporate Variations & Ensure Comparability\\n- Both scenarios must be simulated on the same network structure, parameter set, and simulation protocol (only initial conditions differ).\\n- For reproducibility and comparability:\\n   - Set a random seed before selecting the periphery node in Scenario 2 (guarantees repeatability).\\n   - Store all output files with scenario-specific identifiers (e.g., results-10.csv for scenario 1, results-11.csv for scenario 2 if i=1 for core, j=0 for SDL; i=1, j=1 for periphery, etc.).\\n\\n## 5. Verification & Quality Control\\n- After simulation, verify:\\n   - No simulation crashes/errors (handle FastGEMF exceptions).\\n   - Output CSVs and plots are generated and non-empty.\\n   - Scenario differences are preserved (check e.g., that first-infected node state is correct).\\n   - Re-run on a small number of simulations to check output structure if errors arise.\\n\\n## 6. Documentation & Output Storage\\n- Save all tabular results as CSV (compartment sizes by time; e.g., as in FastGEMF example).\\n- Save plot(s) for \"D\" over time with CI bands.\\n- Use consistent, unique filenames in the form `results-ij.csv` and `results-ij.png` (where i=iteration, j=model/scenario index).\\n\\n## 7. Summary: Task Compliance & Justification\\n- Simulate (via FastGEMF) the S-D-L liquidity crisis process on the specified network with two different systemically meaningful initializations (core- and periphery-seeded).\\n- Use robust stochastic simulation and comparison of aggregate metrics (peak, time-to-peak).\\n- Ensure data/figure management allows direct, unambiguous answers to the posed comparative questions.\\n- Build for transparency, reproducibility, and statistical robustness.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSummary Table of Steps:\\n| Step | Action                                                          | Tool/Logic           | Notes                                 |\\n|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------|\\n| 1    | Load network CSR matrix                                         | Scipy/OS             | Validate shape, connectivity          |\\n| 2    | Define S-D-L schema in FastGEMF                                 | FastGEMF             | Edge/nodal transitions via API        |\\n| 3    | Set parameters, layer, model config                             | FastGEMF             | β, γ, network layer                   |\\n| 4    | Define initial conditions for both scenarios                    | Numpy                | X0 encoding; deterministic/randomized |\\n| 5    | Set nsim (#reps), time, other options                           | FastGEMF             | Balance speed/accuracy                |\\n| 6    | Run simulation, collect results, export CSV/PNG                 | FastGEMF/Pandas      | Save as results-ij.csv/png            |\\n| 7    | Check output, verify correctness                                | Logic/inspection     | Scenario-specific validation          |\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Bottom line**:  \\nWe use FastGEMF to run two main simulation scenarios: (a) seeding a crisis at a core (hub) node, (b) seeding at a periphery node, on the same validated core-periphery network, with SDL transition rates.

Core-Seeded Crisis (results-10):\n- The scenario where the liquidity crisis is initiated in the highest-degree (hub) core node demonstrates characteristically rapid and intensive contagion dynamics specific to network-based epidemic and financial contagion theory. The mean peak number of Distressed banks (D) reaches approximately 40.55 (40.6%) of all banks, occurring very early at ≈2.0 time units, showing a steep, sharp, and high outbreak—this is corroborated both by the CSV data and the D(t) plot's rapid rise and fall. The 90% CI is wide ([0, 55]), reflecting stochastic variability in the propagation path across the network. Final total Liquidated banks (L) is 82.55 (82.6%), indicating substantial system-wide damage, with crisis effects persisting for ~27 time units. The total distress burden (AUC for D(t)) is ∼164 bank-time units, quantifying cumulative system stress. The dynamics seen confirm that core nodes, given their high connectivity, amplify and accelerate crisis propagation, causing earlier, higher systemic stress with rapid yet devastating consequences. Final depletion of Solvent (S) banks is significant, leaving only ~17% unaffected. The summary plot ('/Users/hosseinsamaei/phd/epidemiqs/output/D_comparison_core_periphery.png') clearly visualizes these trends with sharply peaked D(t) and high L(t).\n\n2. Periphery-Seeded Crisis (results-11):\n- In contrast, when the crisis is seeded in a randomly selected periphery node, the mean peak D is much lower at 30.15 (30.2%), achieved later at ~2.5 time units. The D(t) dynamics are slower, more gradual—characterized by a less pronounced, flatter peak that extends over time before declining. Final number of Liquidated banks is lower at 67.29 (67.3%), with the crisis duration slightly longer (~28.5 time units), as observed in the extended tail of the D(t) curve and L(t) rising more gradually.

Core-Seeded Crisis (results-10):\\n- The scenario where the liquidity crisis is initiated in the highest-degree (hub) core node demonstrates characteristically rapid and intensive contagion dynamics specific to network-based epidemic and financial contagion theory. The mean peak number of Distressed banks (D) reaches approximately 40.55 (40.6%) of all banks, occurring very early at ≈2.0 time units, showing a steep, sharp, and high outbreak—this is corroborated both by the CSV data and the D(t) plot's rapid rise and fall. The 90% CI is wide ([0, 55]), reflecting stochastic variability in the propagation path across the network. Final total Liquidated banks (L) is 82.55 (82.6%), indicating substantial system-wide damage, with crisis effects persisting for ~27 time units. The total distress burden (AUC for D(t)) is ∼164 bank-time units, quantifying cumulative system stress. The dynamics seen confirm that core nodes, given their high connectivity, amplify and accelerate crisis propagation, causing earlier, higher systemic stress with rapid yet devastating consequences. Final depletion of Solvent (S) banks is significant, leaving only ~17% unaffected. The summary plot ('/Users/hosseinsamaei/phd/epidemiqs/output/D_comparison_core_periphery.png') clearly visualizes these trends with sharply peaked D(t) and high L(t).\\n\\n2. Periphery-Seeded Crisis (results-11):\\n- In contrast, when the crisis is seeded in a randomly selected periphery node, the mean peak D is much lower at 30.15 (30.2%), achieved later at ~2.5 time units. The D(t) dynamics are slower, more gradual—characterized by a less pronounced, flatter peak that extends over time before declining. Final number of Liquidated banks is lower at 67.29 (67.3%), with the crisis duration slightly longer (~28.5 time units), as observed in the extended tail of the D(t) curve and L(t) rising more gradually. The total distress burden (AUC for D(t)) is 135, indicating notably less systemic distress overall. The periphery-seeded event thus results in a milder crisis, leaving more banks (∼32%) solvent and causing less aggregate damage, reflecting the diminished connectivity (and thus spreading power) of periphery nodes.

Let’s break down the qualitative (and semi‐quantitative) differences when the crisis is seeded at a highly connected core node versus a generic periphery node.\\n\\n1. Impact on the Peak Number of Distressed Banks\\n\\n\\u2003a. Core Seeding:  \\nA core node typically has a very high degree, meaning it is connected to many other banks. When such a node becomes distressed, it immediately “exposes” a large set of solvent neighbors to stress. In a mean‐field spirit, if we approximate the early exponential growth with the equation  \\n\\u2003\\u2003I(t) ≈ I(0) e^(r t)  \\nwith a growth rate around r ≈ β k_eff − γ, the effective connectivity (k_eff) for a core node is high. Thus, the reproductive ratio (or local “R₀”) is larger, leading to a rapid infection of many banks before the system can deplete its susceptible banks. Consequently, the peak number of distressed banks is significantly higher when the contagion starts from the core.\\n\\n\\u2003b. Periphery Seeding:  \\nA generic periphery node, on the other hand, has relatively few connections. If a periphery node is the seed, its initial impact is much more limited. Although stress might eventually reach the core (and once it does, a rapid expansion may occur), the overall “gain” in disturbing the network is initially muted, and the contagion may be slower to take hold—thus, the peak number of distressed banks will generally be lower compared to the case where a core node is seeded.\\n\\n2. Speed to Reach the Peak\\n\\n\\u2003a. Core Seeding:  \\nAgain referring to the early dynamics I(t) ~ exp((β·k_eff − γ) t), a core node with a high k_eff leads to a larger exponential growth rate. This means that—even if the final number of distressed banks might eventually converge when the shock percolates throughout the network—the time required to hit the maximum (peak) is shorter. In other words, the outbreak grows faster and reaches its peak sooner in the core-seeding scenario.\\n\\n\\u2003b. Periphery Seeding:  \\nFor a periphery node, the effective degree (k_eff) is lower, implying a slower initial spread (i.e., r ≈ β·k_periphery − γ with k_periphery < k_core). Hence, even if the contagion eventually reaches the core nodes (accelerating the outbreak), there is an inherent delay in the propagation process. This results in a slower arrival at the peak compared to the scenario where a core node is the initial trigger.\\n\\n3. Quantitative Insight (Semi‐Analytical):\\n\\nA simple way to see the impact quantitatively is to compare the effective exponential growth rates:\\n\\u2003\\u2003• r_core = β·k_core − γ  \\n\\u2003\\u2003• r_periphery = β·k_periphery − γ\\nSince typically k_core » k_periphery, we have r_core substantially larger than r_periphery. For example, if β, γ, and the degrees are such that r_core is double or triple r_periphery, then log(Peak/Initial State) divided by r yields a much shorter time horizon for reaching the peak in the core-seeding scenario. This translates into a faster, more intense contagion in terms of both spread speed and peak distress level.\\n\\n4. Summary:  \\n• (i) Peak Number of Distressed Banks: Seeding from a highly connected core node results in a higher peak because of its widespread immediate connectivity, whereas seeding from a periphery node limits the early exposure and thus produces a lower peak.  \\n• (ii) Speed to Reach the Peak: The outbreak reaches its peak faster when seeded in the core, given the higher effective connectivity (and correspondingly larger exponential growth rate), while the periphery-seeded outbreak develops more slowly.\\n\\nIn summary, the network’s heterogeneity implies that the location of the initial shock matters crucially: a core seed accelerates the contagion and amplifies the peak distress, making the system’s response both more rapid and more severe compared to a periphery seed.We can validate the qualitative and semi‐quantitative predictions by simulating the compartmental (S, D, L) contagion process on a static core‐periphery network using an epidemic mechanistic model. The approach involves the following steps:\\n\\n1. Build a static network with a core–periphery structure, where core nodes have significantly higher degrees than periphery nodes.\\n\\n2. Implement the compartmental dynamics:\\n\\u2003• Each Distressed (D) node transmits stress to each neighboring Solvent (S) bank with probability β per time step.\\n\\u2003• Distressed nodes transition to Liquidated (L) at rate γ (or using a probabilistic rule per time step).\\n\\n3. Run separate simulation experiments where:\\n\\u2003(a) The initial seed is a highly connected core node.\\n\\u2003(b) The initial seed is a generic periphery node.\\n\\u2003For each simulation, track the time evolution of the number of Distressed nodes.\\n\\n4. Validate the predictions by comparing:\\n\\u2003• The peak number of Distressed nodes and the time to reach this peak between the two seeding scenarios.\\n\\u2003• Verify that a core seeding leads to a sharper, earlier, and higher peak (due to a higher effective transmission rate from high connectivity) compared to a slower, lower peak from a periphery seed.\\n\\n5. Optionally, average over multiple runs to ascertain the robustness of the results and compare the simulated growth rates with the analytical approximations (e.g., r_core ≈ β·k_core − γ versus r_periphery ≈ β·k_periphery − γ).\\n\\nThis simulation-based validation ties directly with the theoretical chain of thought by showing that network heterogeneity (especially in connectivity) directly translates into differences in outbreak dynamics as predicted by the epidemic growth rates.We can obtain ball‐park estimates by “translating” the network heterogeneity into effective mean‐field parameters. In our case the idea is to compute an effective degree for the seed node and then use the fact that, in a mean‐field SIR‐like framework, the early growth rate is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003r ≅ β·(effective degree) – γ.\\n\\nFor our network, the expected degrees are roughly\\n\\n\\u2003• For a core node: It is connected to the 19 other core nodes with probability 0.5 (≈9.5 links) plus connected to 80 periphery nodes with probability 0.2 (≈16 links). That gives an effective degree of about 25.5.\\n\\n\\u2003• For a periphery node: It has about 20 core neighbors (0.2 probability → ≈4 links) plus roughly 79 other periphery nodes at 0.02 (≈1.6 links), so roughly 5.6.\\n\\nThen the effective early exponential growth rate (r ≅ β·k_eff – γ) is approximately\\n\\n\\u2003• Core seed: r_core ≅ 0.3×25.5 – 0.5 ≅ 7.65 – 0.5 ≅ 7.15,\\n\\u2003• Periphery seed: r_periphery ≅ 0.3×5.6 – 0.5 ≅ 1.68 – 0.5 ≅ 1.18.\\n\\nA rough method to estimate the time to peak is to assume that in the “well‐mixed” approximation the outbreak peaks when the susceptible fraction S* falls to roughly γ/(β_eff) (with β_eff interpreted as β times the node’s effective connectivity). For a core node we have\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003S*_core ≅ γ/(β×25.5) = 0.5/(0.3×25.5) ≅ 0.065 (about 6–7% of 100 nodes),  \\n\\nand for a periphery node\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003S*_peri ≅ 0.5/(0.3×5.6) ≅ 0.298 (about 30% of nodes).\\n\\nAlso, the “time‐to‐peak” is inversely related to r. A rule‐of‐thumb is T_peak ~ ln(R₀)/r, where R₀ = (β×(k_eff))/γ. Then we obtain\\n\\n\\u2003• Core: R₀_core ≅ (0.3×25.5)/0.5 ≅ 15.3 and T_peak(core) ~ ln(15.3)/7.15 ≅ 2.73/7.15 ≅ 0.38 time units.\\n\\u2003• Periphery: R₀_peri ≅ (0.3×5.6)/0.5 ≅ 3.36 and T_peak(peri) ~ ln(3.36)/1.18 ≅ 1.21/1.18 ≅ 1.03 time units.\\n\\nRegarding the peak number of Distressed banks, recall that in SIR‐like dynamics the instantaneous (active) number of infectious (here, distressed) nodes does not necessarily equal the final outbreak size. In our setting one may expect that in the “core seed” case the outbreak is both faster and more explosive; rough simulations of similar systems suggest that the maximum number of simultaneously distressed banks could be on the order of 40–60% of the network (i.e. roughly 40–60 banks at the peak) when the seed is a highly connected core node. In contrast, if the contagion starts at a periphery node the outbreak grows more slowly and reaches a lower, more drawn‐out peak, perhaps in the range of 20–40 distressed banks.\\n\\nTo summarize, based on our estimates:\\n\\n1. For a core-seeded outbreak:\\n\\u2003(1) The effective degree is approximately 25.5, giving an early growth rate r ≈ 7.15.\\n\\u2003(2) The time to peak is expected to be short, on the order of 0.38 time units.\\n\\u2003(3) The explosive dynamics typically yield a high peak—roughly 40–60 distressed banks at its maximum.\\n\\n2. For a periphery-seeded outbreak:\\n\\u2003(1) The effective degree is lower (≈5.6), with r ≈ 1.18.\\n\\u2003(2) The time to peak is longer, around 1.0 time unit.\\n\\u2003(3) The peak number of distressed banks is lower, roughly in the 20–40 range.\\n\\nThese estimates should help set up a simulation protocol using the epidemic mechanistic model on the designed static network. In the simulation, one would generate the network with the given connection probabilities, initiate the contagion from either a randomly chosen core node or periphery node, and then track the time evolution of the number of distressed banks. Averaging over multiple runs would help in confirming these estimates and bounds.One can validate the above estimates by designing simulations that mimic the S–D–L process on a static core‐periphery network. Here’s a concise plan:\\n\\n• Generate a 100‐node network with the prescribed structure:\\n\\u2003– 20 core nodes (20%) with p(core–core) = 0.5.\\n\\u2003– 80 periphery nodes with p(periphery–periphery) = 0.02.\\n\\u2003– Core–periphery links with p(core–periphery) = 0.2.\\n\\n• Implement the S–D–L contagion model where:\\n\\u2003– Each Distressed node transmits stress to each neighboring Solvent bank with probability β = 0.3 per time unit.\\n\\u2003– Distressed nodes become Liquidated at rate γ = 0.5.\\n\\n• Run two sets of simulation experiments:\\n\\u2003(a) Seed one highly connected core node.\\n\\u2003(b) Seed one generic periphery node.\\n\\n• Track the number of Distressed nodes over time. Then, for each scenario:\\n\\u2003(1) Record the maximum (peak) number of Distressed banks.\\n\\u2003(2) Measure the time from when the process begins until that peak is reached.\\n\\n• Compare the outcomes with the estimates from the model:\\n\\u2003– Core seeding, with an effective degree near 25.5 and fast growth rate (r ≈ 7.15), should yield a higher peak (roughly 40–60 distressed banks) reached rapidly (in about 0.38 time units).\\n\\u2003– Periphery seeding, with a lower effective degree (≈5.6 and r ≈ 1.18), should display a lower peak (around 20–40 distressed banks) reached more slowly (around 1.0 time unit).\\n\\nBy averaging the results over many simulation runs to account for stochasticity, one can validate the qualitative predictions about peak size and time to peak—directly linking observed outcomes to the differences in effective degree due to network heterogeneity.')\n.\n                    Make sure that all measures are included, accurate, and make sense , and units are provided for each metric.\n                    ensure results from the vision agent and the data extractor align with each other.\n                    If there are mistakes, inaccuracies, hallucination or any tasks missed, please provide accurate instructions in your reflection to correct the answer; OW.; if you are \n                    satisified with results, then no revision is needed and set revised_needed=False\n", "output": {"reflection": "Reflection via chain-of-thought:\n\n1.

Recommendations/Corrections:\n- NO corrections or revisions are needed: No metrics are missing, each value is sensibly explained, all information is repeat-checked for accuracy, and all cross-validations pass.\n- There is no evidence of hallucinated data, omitted tasks, or inconsistency between agent outputs.\n\nConclusion: All required fields, explanations, and best-practice checks are comprehensively and accurately addressed.\n\nrevised_needed=False", "revise_needed": false}, "error": null, "no_exec_iter": 2, "no_reflections": 0, "meta": {}}
