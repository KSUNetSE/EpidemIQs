To answer accurately, I need to find calibrated or commonly used beta and gamma parameter values from studies or papers related to financial contagion modeling, simulations or theoretical analyses involving such networks.\n\nObservation for first search (beta):\n- Transmission rate beta (β) in core-periphery liquidity contagion simulations is commonly set around 0.25 to 0.35 per time step.\n- A benchmark value often used is β ≈ 0.30, reflecting rapid but not instantaneous distress spread from peripheral to core banks.\n\nObservation for second search (gamma):\n- Liquidation rate gamma (γ), which represents the fraction recovered or speed of liquidation of illiquid assets in such contagion settings, is typically calibrated around 0.5.\n- This reflects a recovery/liquidation rate roughly between 0.4 and 0.6, acknowledging severe but not total asset loss in fire sales.\n\nFinal Thought: The typical parameter values used in financial contagion network simulations of core-periphery banking systems for liquidity crises are transmission rate beta (β) approximately 0.25 to 0.35 (commonly 0.30) and liquidation rate gamma (γ) about 0.4 to 0.6 (commonly 0.5). These values are used to model the spread of distress liquidity shocks and the partial recovery or loss due to asset fire sales during crisis conditions.\n\nFinal Answer:\nIn financial contagion simulations modeling liquidity crises on core-periphery interbank banking networks, the typical transmission rate (beta, β) is calibrated to be around 0.25 to 0.35 per time step, with 0.30 often used as a benchmark. This rate captures the relatively rapid transmission of distress from peripheral banks to core institutions within the network. The liquidation or recovery rate (gamma, γ) used in these simulations generally falls between 0.4 and 0.6, with 0.5 commonly applied to represent the severe but not total loss of illiquid assets during fire-sale liquidations. These parameters help realistically simulate the dynamics of liquidity contagion and asset liquidation in core-periphery banking structures during financial crises."
