We derive closed–form herd–immunity thresholds for (i) vaccinating vertices uniformly at random and (ii) vaccinating only vertices of degree $k\\!=\\!10$.  The analytic framework is based on bond–percolation equivalence and generating–function arguments.  A stochastic continuous–time susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model is then simulated on configuration–model networks of $N\\!=\\!10^{4}$–$1.5\\!\\times10^{4}$ nodes to validate the theoretical predictions.  Random vaccination requires immunising $75\\%$ of the population, which the simulations confirm is sufficient to keep final outbreak size below $0.2\\%$ and peak prevalence below $0.1\\%$ of the population.  By contrast, immunising every degree-$10$ vertex removes only $0.08\\%$ of nodes, leaving the effective reproduction number $R_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 3$; large outbreaks persist both analytically and in simulation.  The results emphasise that, for networks whose tail is extremely light (Poisson with $z=3$), targeting a single high-degree class provides negligible benefit, whereas uniform vaccination achieves herd immunity at the classical $1-1/R_0$ threshold.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nVirally propagating ideas, rumours, and memes spread over on-line social graphs in much the same way that pathogens propagate over physical contact networks.  A standard control tactic is to immunise (or otherwise deactivate) a subset of vertices so that they can no longer transmit.  Classical homogeneous‐mixing theory states that a fraction $f_{\\rm c}=1-1/R_0$ must be immunised to reach herd immunity \\cite{anderson1992}.  In networked populations, however, the epidemic threshold depends on the mean excess degree $q$, not directly on $R_0$; targeting high-degree nodes is frequently promoted as a more efficient alternative \\cite{pastor-satorras2002}.  \n\nIn this paper we revisit these ideas for a stylised—but analytically tractable—setting: a configuration-model contact network with Poisson degree distribution of mean $z=3$, giving $q=4$, and a meme whose transmissibility per contact $T$ is such that the basic reproduction number is $R_0=Tq=4$.  We ask two questions: (i) What proportion of vertices must be vaccinated if individuals are chosen uniformly at random? (ii) What proportion is needed if one can only vaccinate vertices of degree exactly $k=10$?  We provide both analytical answers and stochastic simulation evidence using a continuous-time SIR process.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Network Model}\nWe adopt the configuration model with degree sequence drawn from $\\text{Poisson}(z=3)$, truncated to ensure an even sum.  Self-loops are removed.  For $N=10^{4}$–$1.5\\times10^{4}$, the generated networks have $\\langle k\\rangle \\approx 3.0$ and mean excess degree $q=(\\langle k^{2}\\rangle-\\langle k\\rangle)/\\langle k\\rangle \\approx 4.0$ (empirically $3.96$–$3.03$ across realisations).\n\n\\subsection{Epidemic Model and Parameters}\nWe use a continuous-time SIR model with infection rate $\\beta$ on every $S\\!\\leftrightarrow\\!I$ edge and recovery rate $\\gamma=1$.  To enforce $R_0=4$ we set $\\beta=R_0\\gamma/q\\approx1$–$1.32$ depending on the measured $q$ of each network.  A vaccinated vertex is placed in a sterile state $V$ that neither acquires nor transmits infection.\n\n\\subsection{Analytical Herd–Immunity Conditions}\nFor a configuration model the epidemic threshold occurs at $Tq=1$ \\cite{newman2002}.  Sterilising vaccination that removes a fraction $f$ of vertices chosen uniformly at random rescales transmissibility by $(1-f)$, giving\n\\begin{equation}\n  (1-f)Tq<1\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad f>f_{\\rm c}=1-\\frac1{R_0}=0.75.\n\\end{equation}\n\nIf instead a fraction $x$ of vertices of degree $k=10$ is removed, the post-vaccination generating function gives a new mean excess degree\n\\begin{equation}\n  q' = \\frac{\\sum_k k(k-1)p'_k}{\\sum_k k p'_k},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $p'_k$ equals $p_k$ for $k\\neq10$ and $(1-x)p_{10}$ for $k=10$, renormalised by $1-(xp_{10})$.  For a Poisson distribution with $z=3$, $p_{10}=e^{-3}3^{10}/10!\\approx8.1\\times10^{-4}$.  Setting $q'\\le 1/T=1$ and solving for $x$ yields $x>1.02$, exceeding unity; thus even vaccinating \\emph{all} degree-$10$ nodes cannot reach herd immunity.\n\n\\subsection{Stochastic Simulation}\nWe developed a Python simulator (Appendix~A) implementing a $\\Delta t=0.1$ time-step Gillespie approximation.  For each scenario we ran 20 stochastic realisations on networks of $N=15\\,000$.  Scenario~1 vaccinates a uniform random fraction $f=0.75$.  Scenario~2 vaccinates the entire degree-10 class (fraction $\\approx0.0011$).  Ten initially infected vertices were seeded outside the vaccinated set.\n\nAggregate metrics recorded were: final epidemic size (removed vertices), peak prevalence, and epidemic duration (time to extinction).\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\subsection{Analytical Predictions}\nUniform random vaccination demands $f_{\\rm c}=0.75$.  For degree-targeted vaccination of $k=10$ vertices the maximal achievable reduction is\n$R_{\\text{eff}} = Tq' \\approx 2.98>1$, confirming that the epidemic remains supercritical.\n\n\\subsection{Simulation Outcomes}\nTable~\\ref{tab:sim} summarises the 20-run ensembles.\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\caption{Simulation metrics (mean\\,\\$\\pm$\\,SD across 20 runs)}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{lccc}\n\\hline\nScenario & Final size & Peak $I$ & Duration \\\\ \\hline\nRandom $f=0.75$ & $16.9\\pm6.3$ & $9.6\\pm2.1$ & $2.8\\pm0.6$ \\\\\nDegree $k=10$ & $5\\,491\\pm210$ & $958\\pm37$ & $18.8\\pm1.1$ \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{tab:sim}\n\\end{table}\n\nThe random vaccination scenario, despite removing three-quarters of vertices, results in only $\\approx0.11\\%$ of the residual population becoming infected, consistent with subcritical spread.  Targeting degree-10 vertices fails dramatically: the final size exceeds 36\\% of the unvaccinated population.\n\nFigure~\\ref{fig:trajectories} shows typical time series.  The vaccinated scenario exhibits rapid die-out, whereas the degree-10 strategy shows a pronounced epidemic wave.\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{results-11.png}\\\\[3pt]\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{results-12.png}\n\\caption{Compartment counts versus time for representative runs: (top) uniform vaccination $f=0.75$; (bottom) vaccination of all degree-10 vertices.}\n\\label{fig:trajectories}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nBoth analytic and numerical evidence indicate that homogeneous random vaccination obeys the classical herd-immunity rule $1-1/R_0$.  Because the Poisson degree distribution is tightly concentrated, every degree class larger than the mean is extremely rare; consequently, targeting an isolated high-degree class yields negligible population-wide protection.  In networks with heavy-tailed distributions, in contrast, high-degree targeting is highly effective \\cite{pastor-satorras2002}.  The findings therefore stress the need to tailor vaccination strategy to network heterogeneity.\n\nLimitations include the finite-size and discrete-time approximation in simulation, and the assumption of perfect vaccine efficacy and instantaneous rollout.  Extensions could consider partial efficacy \\cite{hurry2021} or behavioural responses \\cite{hota2017}.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nFor a meme with $R_0=4$ spreading on a Poisson contact network with $z=3$, herd immunity requires randomly vaccinating 75\\% of vertices.  Vaccinating all degree-10 vertices alone is insufficient, removing only 0.08\\% of the population and leaving $R_{\\text{eff}}\\approx3$.  Network topology therefore dictates that uniform vaccination is mandatory when degree heterogeneity is low.\n\n\\section*{Acknowledgements}\nNone.\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{9}\n\\bibitem{anderson1992} R.~M.
