Based on the analysis of COVID-19 transmission, this paper divides the population into three categories: susceptible category, discovered disease category and immune category consisting of cure and death, and proposes two models: crowd contact network and contact network-based SIR model to simulate the transmission process of SIR; then absorbs the idea of synchronous update of cellular automaton model, and finally establishes a contact network-based SIR model whose members are affected by all passengers at the same time simulation model.

Services, are among many others, were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the years 2020 and 2021; but its impact on the TB transmission is not well understood. This retrospective population-based molecular and epidemiological cohort study aims to determine the pattern of TB transmission in Kuala Lumpur (an area with high population density, moderate TB burden and high rates of COVID-19 cases) for the cohort of Pulmonary TB (PTB) cases notified from 2020 until 2021 and factors associated with clustering or clear epidemiologic linkage. This study will be carried out from 2022 until 2024. The study will utilise comparative phylogenetic analysis to determine the degree of relatedness between different isolates, based on the genomes similarities, and overlay this with epidemiological, clinical and social network data to enhance understanding of the social-behavioural dynamics of TB transmission. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) cultures will be genotyped using Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Unit Variable Number Tandem Repeats (MIRU-VNTR) and whole-genome sequence (WGS) for MTBC cluster isolates. Epidemiologic and genomic data will be overlaid on a social network constructed by means of interviews with patients, by using Social Network Analysis questionnaire, to determine the origins and transmission dynamics of the outbreak. The finding of this study would aid in the identification of TB transmission events, facilitating active case finding, TB screening, TB contact tracing, and the mapping of social contacts during critical period.

                    "abstract": "The growth of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has turned into an unprecedented pandemic in the last century. It is crucial to identify superspreading nodes to prevent the pandemic\u2019s progress. Most available superspreader identification techniques consider only a single or few network metrics related to the complex network\u2019s topological structure. Furthermore, it is more challenging to determine influential spreaders from heterogeneous structures of networks. In a disease transmission network, the degree of heterogeneity is essential to locate the path of the infection spread. Therefore, it is required to have an extended degree of centrality to collect information from various neighborhood levels. This article presents an approach, namely, global structure influence (GSI), which considers network nodes\u2019 local and global influence. This method can gather information from multiple levels of the neighborhood. Evaluation of our proposed method is done by considering different types of networks, i.e., social networks, highly heterogeneous human contact networks, and epidemiological networks, and also by using the benchmark susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model. The GSI technique provides real-spreading dynamics across various network structures and has outperformed the baseline techniques with an average Kendall\u2019s $\\tau $ improvement range from 0.017 to 0.278. This study will help to identify the superspeaders in real applications, where pathogens spread quickly because of close contact, such as the recently witnessed COVID-19 pandemic.",

However, limited data on topological structural features has hindered in-depth studies. Existing research is based on snapshot analyses, preventing temporal investigations of network changes. Comparing network characteristics over time offers additional insights into transmission dynamics.

The present study aims to design a resilient health system to offer medical services to COVID-19 patients and prevent further disease outbreaks by social distancing, resiliency, cost, and commuting distance as decisive factors. It incorporated three novel resiliency measures (i.e., health facility criticality, patient dissatisfaction level, and dispersion of suspicious people) to promote the designed health network against potential infectious disease threats. Also, it introduced a novel hybrid uncertainty programming to resolve a mixed degree of the inherent uncertainty in the multi-objective problem, and it adopted an interactive fuzzy approach to address it. The actual data obtained from a case study in Tehran province in Iran proved the strong performance of the presented model. The findings show that the optimum use of medical centers\u2019 potential and the corresponding decisions result in a more resilient health system and cost reduction. A further outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is also prevented by shortening the commuting distance for patients and avoiding the increasing congestion in the medical centers. Also, the managerial insights show that establishing and evenly distributing camps and quarantine stations within the community and designing an efficient network for patients with different symptoms result in the optimum use of the potential capacity of medical centers and a decrease in the rate of bed shortage in the hospitals. Another insight drawn is that an efficient allocation of the suspect and definite cases to the nearest screening and care centers makes it possible to prevent the disease carriers from commuting within the community and increase the coronavirus transmission rate.",

In this study, we assess the competitive interactions between the Omicron variant and other prominent variants (Alpha, Beta, and Delta) on a social network, considering both single infection and coinfection states. Using the SIRS model, we simulate the progression of these variants and analyze their impact on infection rates, mortality, and overall disease burden. Our findings demonstrate that the Alpha and Beta strains exhibit comparable contagion levels, with the Alpha strain displaying higher infection and mortality rates. Moreover, the Delta strain emerges as the most prevalent and virulent strain, surpassing the other variants. When introduced alongside the less virulent Omicron strain, the Delta strain results in higher infection and mortality rates. However, the Omicron strain's dominance leads to an overall increase in disease statistics. Remarkably, our study highlights the efficacy of the Omicron variant in supplanting more virulent strains and its potential role in mitigating the spread of infectious diseases. The Omicron strain demonstrates a competitive advantage over the other variants, suggesting its potential to reduce the severity of the disease and alleviate the burden on healthcare systems. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring and understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 variants, as they can inform effective prevention and mitigation strategies, particularly with the emergence of variants that possess a relative advantage in controlling disease transmission.",

We systematically compare the exact solution with mean-field predictions obtained from a treelike random rewiring of the network, which preserves only the degree sequence. Our results demonstrate a nontrivial interplay between degree heterogeneity, correlations and network topology, which can significantly alter both the percolation threshold and the critical exponents predicted by the mean-field.

To do so, we extend the cavity method to study networks where nodes have heterogeneous transmissibility. We find that vaccination with partial transmission still provides herd immunity and show how the herd immunity threshold depends upon the assortativity between nodes of different transmissibility. In addition, we study the impact of social distancing via bond percolation and show that percolation targeting links between nodes of high transmissibility can reduce the risk of an epidemic greater than targeting links between nodes of high degree. Finally, we extend recent methods to compute the distributional equations of risk in populations with heterogeneous transmissibility and show how targeted social distancing measures may reduce overall risk greater than untargeted vaccination campaigns, by comparing the effect of random and targeted strategies of node and link deletion on the risk distribution.",

We show that even for strongly heterogeneous distributions, the GUC always appears at a finite threshold and its formation is characterized by homogeneous mean-field percolation critical exponents. The threshold is a nonmonotonic function of connectivity: robustness is maximized by networks with finite optimal average degree. We also show that if the average degree is large enough, a damaged phase appears, characterized by the existence of a GDC, bounded by two distinct percolation transitions. The birth and the dismantling of the GDC are characterized by standard percolation critical exponents in networks, except for the dismantling in scale-free networks where new critical exponents are found.

Its effectivity can be quantified by modifying the standard methodology for analyzing percolation and connectivity of contact networks. We apply this framework to networks with varying degree distributions, numbers of application users, and probabilities of quarantine failures. Further, we study structured populations with homophily and heterophily and the possibility of degree-targeted application distribution. Our results are based on a combination of explicit simulations and mean-field analysis. They indicate that there can be major differences in the epidemic size and epidemic probabilities which are equivalent in the normal susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) processes. Further, degree heterogeneity is seen to be especially important for the epidemic threshold but not as much for the epidemic size. The probability that tracing leads to quarantines is not as important as the application adoption rate. Finally, both strong homophily and especially heterophily with regard to application adoption can be detrimental. Overall, epidemic dynamics are very sensitive to all of the parameter values we tested out, which makes the problem of estimating the effect of digital contact tracing an inherently multidimensional problem.",

Because of the heterogeneous structure of a complex network, the probability of a node to be an articulation point or the probability of an edge to be a bredge will not be homogeneous across the network. We therefore analyze full distributions of articulation point probabilities as well as bredge probabilities, using a message-passing or cavity approach to the problem. Our methods allow us to obtain these distributions both for large single instances of networks and for ensembles of networks in the configuration model class in the thermodynamic limit, through a single unified approach. We also evaluate deconvolutions of these distributions according to degrees of the node or the degrees of both adjacent nodes in the case of bredges. We obtain closed form expressions for the large mean degree limit of Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks. Moreover, we reveal and are able to rationalize a significant amount of structure in the evolution of articulation point and bredge probabilities in response to random bond removal.

Here, we address this problem by suggesting a novel method based on heterogeneous mean-field theory for the SIS model. Our method builds the relationship between the thresholds and different immunization strategies in completely random networks.

Then based on the continuous degree technique, namely, considering the degree of a node as a continuous variable, we propose a method to calculate the epidemic threshold of the immunized network. Besides, some immunization strategies, including optimal immunization, random immunization, combined targeted immunization, and combined acquaintance immunization, and three special networks are considered.

It is achieved using a cavity or message passing approach, which allows one to obtain the essential ingredient required for the solution, viz. a self-consistent determination of locally varying percolation probabilities. The cavity solution can be evaluated both for single large instances of locally treelike graphs, and in the thermodynamic limit of random graphs of finite mean degree in the configuration model class. The critical level h_{c} of the percolation transition is obtained through the condition that the largest eigenvalue of a weighted version B of a nonbacktracking matrix satisfies \u03bb_{max}(B)|_{h_{c}}=1. We present level-dependent distributions of local percolation probabilities for Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks and and for networks with degree distributions described by power laws. We find that there is a strong correlation between marginal single-node variances of a massless multivariate Gaussian and local percolation probabilities at a given level h, which is nearly perfect at negative values h, but weakens as h\u21970 for the system with power-law degree distribution, and generally also for negative values of h, if the multivariate Gaussian acquires a nonzero mass. The theoretical analysis simplifies in the case of random regular graphs with uniform edge weights of the weighted graph Laplacian of the system and uniform mass parameter of the Gaussian field. An asymptotic analysis reveals that for edge weights K=K(c)\u22611 the critical percolation threshold h_{c} decreases to 0, as the degree c of the random regular graph diverges. For K=(c)=1/c, however, the critical percolation threshold h_{c} is shown to diverge as c\u2192\u221e.",

                    "abstract": "The incidental detection of adrenal masses by imaging is increasingly common in clinical practice owing to the ever-increasing use of cross-sectional imaging. Adrenal incidentalomas are found in about 5% of the population, and incidence increases with age (1). When an adrenal incidentaloma is detected, a systematic biochemical work-up is required to exclude excess secretion of adrenal hormones. In most cases, further radiologic work-up also ensues to exclude cancer. The mainstay management strategy for both overt hormone excess and cancer is adrenalectomy (2). Whereas most adrenal incidentalomas are benign nonfunctioning adrenal tumors (NFATs), about 15% are associated with hormone excess (3). A frequent finding in patients with adrenal incidentalomas is failure to suppress cortisol sufficiently after dexamethasone administration in the absence of typical clinical signs of cortisol excess (3), a condition often called subclinical Cushing syndrome or, as recently coined, mild autonomous cortisol excess (MACE). Generally, NFATs do not require surgery, whereas whether MACE adenomas should be removed is controversial (2, 4, 5), despite several studies suggesting that MACE may result in increased risk for cardiometabolic disease and death (68). Whether NFATs should undergo long-term follow-up is also debatable because of the substantial health economic burden and increased radiation exposure from potentially unnecessary repeated imaging. However, NFATs may be associated with increased cardiometabolic risk during follow-up (9, 10), and marked increases in adenoma size and development of clinically overt hormone excess over time have been reported (1114). Adrenal incidentaloma guidelines from the National Institutes of Health and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend repeated imaging and hormonal assessment for up to 5 years for tumors characterized at diagnosis as benign without overt hormonal hypersecretion (15, 16). Recent European guidelines discourage repeated imaging and hormonal assessment but recommend annual screening for overt Cushing syndrome in patients with MACE (2). These considerable differences in recommendations reflect the inadequacy of evidence that informs the follow-up of adrenal incidentalomas without an immediate indication for surgery. Most previous studies that addressed the natural history of NFAT and MACE were done in small cohorts of heterogeneous populations and used varied biochemical and radiologic assessments. Therefore, we sought to summarize the available literature and undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the natural history of NFAT and MACE adenomas to better guide their management. Our objectives were to determine the following: 1) the proportion of NFAT and MACE adenomas that increase in size, the degree of growth during follow-up, and the proportion of adenomas that show malignant transformation; 2) the proportion of NFAT and MACE adenomas that change their hormone production during follow-up; 3) the prevalence of hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular events in patients with NFAT or MACE at baseline and their incidence during follow-up; and 4) incident all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with NFAT or MACE during follow-up. Methods The meta-analysis was done according to a predesigned protocol (developed on 16 January 2017), which included methods and inclusion criteria and was developed in conformance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement (17). Data Sources and Searches We did a comprehensive electronic search of multiple databases, including Ovid MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus, for titles published between 1 January 1990 and 20 February 2019. This search strategy (Supplement Table 1) was designed and carried out by an experienced reference librarian (L.P.) with input from a study investigator with experience in conducting systematic reviews (I.B.). Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of the natural history of NFAT and MACE during follow-up. No language restriction was applied. We further searched bibliographies of included articles to identify any eligible studies that the electronic search may have missed. Supplement. Supplementary Material Study Selection We included original studies that evaluated populations of patients with NFAT, MACE, or both. Studies could be prospective or retrospective and had to include adults (aged 18 years) with NFAT or MACE (as defined by authors) (Supplement Table 2), have a sample size of at least 20 conservatively managed patients with at least 12 months of longitudinal follow-up, and report outcomes of interest at baseline and the end of follow-up. We excluded all nonoriginal studies and case reports. We included the following outcomes of interest for which we identified follow-up data for at least 100 patients: change in size of adrenal tumor, malignant transformation, change in hormone secretion, development of hypertension, obesity or weight gain, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular events, and death during follow-up (Supplement Table 3 defines these outcomes). We excluded outcomes with fewer than 100 identified patients, which included bone loss, vertebral fractures, and visceral fat accumulation. Six reviewers independently screened identified studies for eligibility. Conforming to the predefined inclusion criteria, they reviewed the titles and abstracts of identified studies in duplicate and removed all studies that did not fulfill the inclusion criteria at this stage. When reviewers disagreed, studies progressed to the next stage. In this phase, 2 reviewers independently screened full-text articles to assess eligibility for final inclusion, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Data extracted from each study included first author, year of publication, country where the study was done, participant demographics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study design, and prevalence of outcomes of interest at baseline and the end of follow-up. One investigator (Y.S.E.) combined all data extraction forms and resolved discrepancies at this stage by discussing them with the reviewers and referring back to the full-text articles. Pairs of reviewers independently assessed the quality of each included study. The modified NewcastleOttawa Scale for risk-of-bias assessment of observational studies was applied to assess the following domains (Supplement Table 4): selection (whether the cohort of patients with adrenal adenomas was representative), ascertainment (whether glucocorticoid autonomy and ascertainment of outcomes were described clearly), reporting (whether the proportion of patients affected by the studied outcome at baseline was reported clearly), causality (adequacy of follow-up, adequacy of the proportion of baseline patients assessed at follow-up, and similarity of outcome assessment between baseline and follow-up), and funding and conflicts of interest (whether information on funding and conflicts of interest was reported clearly) (18). One investigator (Y.S.E.) combined all of the quality assessment forms and resolved discrepancies by discussion with assessors. Data Synthesis and Analysis We analyzed only outcomes of interest for which the systematic review identified at least 100 patients. For continuous data, we used means and SDs from each study; when studies did not report these directly, we converted available data measures to means and SDs. We then pooled the mean differences from follow-up to baseline across the studies using the random-effects model, with heterogeneity estimated from the MantelHaenszel model. We estimated an exact binomial CI following the ClopperPearson procedures (19). We followed the FreemanTukey double arcsine transformation (20) to stabilize the variances. For dichotomous data, we calculated the event rate from each study group. We then pooled the log-transformed event rates using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models, with heterogeneity estimated from the MantelHaenszel model. All analyses were done using the random-effects model to produce proportion estimates and 95% CIs. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic, which represents the proportion of variability that is not attributable to chance. I 2 values more than 50% indicate substantial heterogeneity. Statistical analyses were done using OpenMeta [Analyst] (Brown University) (21). All values were 2-tailed, and a P value less than 0.05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance. Role of the Funding Source The funders had no role in study design, data collection or analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. Results Characteristics of Included Studies The database search yielded 1111 studies, in addition to 28 identified from bibliographies of screened articles. After screening, 32 studies were included in the analysis (Supplement Table 2). The PRISMA flow diagram outlines the numbers of studies screened, included, and excluded (Figure 1) (22). Of the 32 included studies (7, 10, 1214, 2349), 17 were retrospective and 15 were prospective. Eligible studies were mainly done in Europethat is, Italy (n= 13), Turkey (n= 4), Greece (n= 4), Finland (n= 2), the United Kingdom (n= 1), France (n= 1), Sweden (n= 1), and Spain (n= 1)but also in the United States (n= 2), Japan (n= 1), South Korea (n= 1), and Hong Kong (n= 1). Included studies reported follow-up outcomes of interest on 4121 patients (2873 with NFAT, 784 with MACE, and 464 with either NFAT or MACE; for the latter, it was not possible to disaggregate the baseline or follow-up outcomes on the basis of hormone assessment).

At zero temperature, many of these models exhibit a rigidity transition that separates two phases: a liquid phase and a solid (glassy) phase. This phenomenology is now well established but the theoretical understanding is still not complete. In this work we consider an exactly soluble mean field model for the rigidity transition which is based on an abstract mapping. We replace volume and surface functions by random non-linear functions of a large number of degrees of freedom forced to be on a compact phase space. We then seek for a configuration of the degrees of freedom such that these random non-linear functions all attain the same value. This target value is a control parameter and plays the role of the target cell shape in biological tissue models. Therefore we map the microscopic models of cells to a random continuous constraint satisfaction problem with equality constraints. We argue that at zero temperature, the rigidity transition corresponds to the satisfiability transition of the problem. We also characterize both the satisfiable (SAT) and unsatisfiable (UNSAT) phase. In the SAT phase, before reaching the rigidity transition, the zero temperature SAT landscape undergoes an replica symmetry breaking (RSB)/ergodicity breaking transition of the same type as the Gardner transition in amorphous solids. By solving the RSB equations we compute the SAT/UNSAT threshold and the critical behavior around it. In the UNSAT phase we also compute the average shape index as a function of the target one and we compare the thermodynamical solution of the model with the results of the numerical greedy minimization of the corresponding cost function.",
