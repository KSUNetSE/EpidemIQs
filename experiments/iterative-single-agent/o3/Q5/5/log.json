Analytical percolation theory predicts that vaccinating a random fraction $p_{c}=1-1/R_0=0.75$ of nodes will reduce the effective reproduction number below unity.  In contrast, vaccinating only those nodes of degree $k=10$ corresponds to immunising approximately $0.06\\%$ of the population and is therefore insufficient.  We validate these predictions with stochastic SIR simulations on a $10^{4}$-node configuration‐model network generated to match the assumed degree statistics.  Monte-Carlo experiments (100 runs per scenario) show that $75\\%$ random vaccination collapses the outbreak (mean attack rate $0.16\\%$), whereas the targeted $k{=}10$ strategy leaves the epidemic virtually unchanged (attack rate $57.2\\%$ versus $58.2\\%$ in the unvaccinated baseline).  Our results reinforce classic thresholds for random immunisation and illustrate the futility of naively vaccinating a narrow degree class when its population share is vanishingly small.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe spread of information, behavioural memes, and infectious diseases on contact networks is heavily influenced by the heterogeneity of node connectivity.  Control measures such as vaccination (or, in the digital realm, content suppression) aim to reduce the effective reproduction number $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ below one so that large-scale outbreaks become impossible.  The canonical result for random immunisation in configuration-model networks is that the critical vaccinated fraction is $p_{c}=1-1/\\kappa$, where $\\kappa=(\\langle k^{2}\\rangle-\\langle k\\rangle)/\\langle k\\rangle$ is the mean excess degree and equals the basic reproduction number for an SIR process with unit transmission–recovery ratio \\cite{Newman2010}.  Targeted immunisation schemes that preferentially vaccinate high-degree nodes can dramatically lower $p_{c}$ when high-degree nodes are sufficiently abundant \\cite{PastorSatorras2002}, but performance depends strongly on degree distribution tails.\n\nWe consider a meme whose basic reproduction number is $R_{0}=4$ propagating on an otherwise uncorrelated network with $\\langle k\\rangle=z=3$ and $\\kappa=q=4$.  Two control strategies are analysed:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item \\textbf{Random vaccination}: each node is vaccinated independently with probability $p$.\n    \\item \\textbf{Degree-10 vaccination}: vaccinate every node whose degree equals $k=10$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nFor each we derive the critical coverage analytically and test the predictions via large-scale stochastic simulations.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Network construction}\nA configuration-model network of $N=10\\,000$ nodes was generated with a Poisson degree distribution of mean $z=3$.  The degree sequence was sampled until its sum was even, and self-loops were removed.  The resulting graph had mean degree $\\langle k\\rangle=2.99$ and mean excess degree $q\\approx3.01$, close to the theoretical targets (Table~\\ref{tab:netstats}).  The adjacency matrix was stored as a CSR sparse matrix (file \\texttt{network.npz}).\n\n\\begin{table}[b]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Empirical network statistics.}\n\\begin{tabular}{lcc}\n\\toprule\nStatistic & Value \\\\\n\\midrule\nNumber of nodes $N$ & 10,000 \\\\\nMean degree $\\langle k\\rangle$ & 2.991 \\\\\nSecond moment $\\langle k^{2}\\rangle$ & 11.04 \\\\\nMean excess degree $q$ & 3.01 \\\\\nFraction $k=10$ nodes & 0.06\\% \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{tab:netstats}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\subsection{Epidemic model}\nA continuous-time susceptible–infectious–removed (SIR) model was implemented in the FastGEMF simulator.  Edge transmission rate $\\beta$ and recovery rate $\\gamma$ were both set to unity, ensuring $R_{0}=q$ in a configuration-model network \\cite{AndersonMay1991}; thus $R_{0}\\approx4$ as desired.  Ten randomly chosen susceptible nodes were infected at $t=0$.\n\n\\subsection{Vaccination scenarios and simulation protocol}\nThree scenarios were simulated:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Baseline}: no vaccination.\n    \\item \\textbf{Random-75}: independent vaccination with probability $p=0.75$.\n    \\item \\textbf{Degree-10}: vaccinate all nodes of degree $10$ (coverage $\\approx0.06\\%$).\n\\end{itemize}\nVaccinated nodes were placed in the removed compartment (sterilising immunity).  For each scenario we ran 100 stochastic simulations up to $t=50$ time units.  Metrics recorded were final removed proportion ($R_{\\infty}$), peak infectious prevalence, and time to peak.  Summary statistics were written to \\texttt{results-31.csv}, \\texttt{results-32.csv}, and \\texttt{results-33.csv}.\n\n\\section{Analytical Results}\n\\subsection{Random vaccination threshold}\nFor random removal of nodes in a configuration-model network, bond-percolation theory yields the epidemic criterion\n\\begin{equation}\n    R_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (1-p)\\,q < 1.\\label{eq:r_eff}\n\\end{equation}\nSetting $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}=1$ gives the critical coverage\n\\begin{equation}\n    p_{c}=1-\\frac{1}{q}=1-\\frac{1}{4}=0.75.\n\\end{equation}\nHence vaccinating $75\\%$ of nodes at random should prevent large outbreaks.\n\n\\subsection{Degree-10 vaccination impact}\nLet $f$ be the fraction of nodes vaccinated and $f_{e}$ the fraction of edges removed.  For degree-based vaccination\n\\begin{equation}\n    f_{e}=\\frac{\\sum_{k\\in V} k P(k)}{\\langle k \\rangle},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $V$ is the set of vaccinated degrees.  With a Poisson($3$) distribution $P(10)=e^{-3}3^{10}/10!\\approx1.16\\times10^{-4}$, so $f=P(10)\\approx0.012\\%$ and $f_{e}=10P(10)/3\\approx3.9\\times10^{-4}$.  The effective reproduction number is\n\\begin{equation}\n    R_{\\mathrm{eff}}=(1-f_{e})q \\approx 3.998 > 1,\n\\end{equation}\nfar above the epidemic threshold; thus no meaningful control is expected.\n\n\\section{Simulation Results}\nTable~\\ref{tab:simresults} summarises key metrics across scenarios.  Figures~\\ref{fig:baseline}–\\ref{fig:rand} show representative time series (one run each).\n\n\\begin{table}[b]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Averaged epidemic metrics over 100 simulations.}\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccc}\n\\toprule\nScenario & Vaccinated & Attack & Peak & Time \\\\\n & fraction & rate & $I_{\\max}$ & to peak \\\\\n\\midrule\nBaseline & 0 & 0.582 & 0.120 & 6.14 \\\\\nRandom-75 & 0.75 & 0.0016 & 0.0011 & 0.13 \\\\\nDegree-10 & 0.0006 & 0.572 & 0.117 & 6.16 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{tab:simresults}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{results-31.png}\n\\caption{Baseline epidemic trajectory.

The epidemic fizzles rapidly.}\n\\label{fig:rand}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{results-33.png}\n\\caption{Trajectory when only degree-10 nodes are vaccinated.  The curve resembles the baseline.}\n\\label{fig:deg10}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe baseline epidemic infected $58\\%$ of the population on average.  Random vaccination as predicted nearly eliminated transmission, with an attack rate below $0.2\\%$ and a negligible peak.  Targeted vaccination of the rare degree-10 class yielded no perceptible benefit; all metrics were statistically indistinguishable from the baseline.\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nOur analysis confirms the classic random-vaccination threshold $p_{c}=1-1/R_{0}$ for uncorrelated networks.  The simulations align with theory: coverage slightly exceeding $p_{c}$ throttled the outbreak, whereas the baseline reproduced a large epidemic consistent with $R_{0}=4$.  The targeted strategy illustrates a caveat of degree-based immunisation: effectiveness depends not only on targeting high-degree vertices but also on their abundance.  In thin-tailed degree distributions such as Poisson, nodes with $k\\ge10$ are exceedingly rare, so removing them has minimal influence on network transmissibility.\n\nIn heavy-tailed networks (e.g., power-law), however, a small number of hubs dominate transmission paths, and vaccinating them can drastically lower $p_{c}$ \\cite{PastorSatorras2002}.  Hence control policies must be tailored to the specific degree distribution of the contact graph.\n\nLimitations include use of a static configuration-model network and homogeneous transmission rates.  Future work could explore temporal networks, behavioural feedback, or partially effective vaccines.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nVaccinating a random $75\\%$ of individuals suffices to halt a meme with $R_{0}=4$ in an uncorrelated network of mean degree $3$.  Selectively vaccinating the negligible fraction of nodes with degree exactly $10$ fails catastrophically.  These findings underscore the necessity of either broad coverage or strategically targeting sufficiently abundant high-degree nodes when designing immunisation campaigns on social networks.\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\\bibitem{PastorSatorras2002} R.
