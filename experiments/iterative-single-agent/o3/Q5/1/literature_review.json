Based on the analysis of COVID-19 transmission, this paper divides the population into three categories: susceptible category, discovered disease category and immune category consisting of cure and death, and proposes two models: crowd contact network and contact network-based SIR model to simulate the transmission process of SIR; then absorbs the idea of synchronous update of cellular automaton model, and finally establishes a contact network-based SIR model whose members are affected by all passengers at the same time simulation model.

Services, are among many others, were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the years 2020 and 2021; but its impact on the TB transmission is not well understood. This retrospective population-based molecular and epidemiological cohort study aims to determine the pattern of TB transmission in Kuala Lumpur (an area with high population density, moderate TB burden and high rates of COVID-19 cases) for the cohort of Pulmonary TB (PTB) cases notified from 2020 until 2021 and factors associated with clustering or clear epidemiologic linkage. This study will be carried out from 2022 until 2024. The study will utilise comparative phylogenetic analysis to determine the degree of relatedness between different isolates, based on the genomes similarities, and overlay this with epidemiological, clinical and social network data to enhance understanding of the social-behavioural dynamics of TB transmission. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) cultures will be genotyped using Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Unit Variable Number Tandem Repeats (MIRU-VNTR) and whole-genome sequence (WGS) for MTBC cluster isolates. Epidemiologic and genomic data will be overlaid on a social network constructed by means of interviews with patients, by using Social Network Analysis questionnaire, to determine the origins and transmission dynamics of the outbreak. The finding of this study would aid in the identification of TB transmission events, facilitating active case finding, TB screening, TB contact tracing, and the mapping of social contacts during critical period.

                    "abstract": "The growth of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has turned into an unprecedented pandemic in the last century. It is crucial to identify superspreading nodes to prevent the pandemic\u2019s progress. Most available superspreader identification techniques consider only a single or few network metrics related to the complex network\u2019s topological structure. Furthermore, it is more challenging to determine influential spreaders from heterogeneous structures of networks. In a disease transmission network, the degree of heterogeneity is essential to locate the path of the infection spread. Therefore, it is required to have an extended degree of centrality to collect information from various neighborhood levels. This article presents an approach, namely, global structure influence (GSI), which considers network nodes\u2019 local and global influence. This method can gather information from multiple levels of the neighborhood. Evaluation of our proposed method is done by considering different types of networks, i.e., social networks, highly heterogeneous human contact networks, and epidemiological networks, and also by using the benchmark susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model. The GSI technique provides real-spreading dynamics across various network structures and has outperformed the baseline techniques with an average Kendall\u2019s $\\tau $ improvement range from 0.017 to 0.278. This study will help to identify the superspeaders in real applications, where pathogens spread quickly because of close contact, such as the recently witnessed COVID-19 pandemic.",

However, limited data on topological structural features has hindered in-depth studies. Existing research is based on snapshot analyses, preventing temporal investigations of network changes. Comparing network characteristics over time offers additional insights into transmission dynamics.

The present study aims to design a resilient health system to offer medical services to COVID-19 patients and prevent further disease outbreaks by social distancing, resiliency, cost, and commuting distance as decisive factors. It incorporated three novel resiliency measures (i.e., health facility criticality, patient dissatisfaction level, and dispersion of suspicious people) to promote the designed health network against potential infectious disease threats. Also, it introduced a novel hybrid uncertainty programming to resolve a mixed degree of the inherent uncertainty in the multi-objective problem, and it adopted an interactive fuzzy approach to address it. The actual data obtained from a case study in Tehran province in Iran proved the strong performance of the presented model. The findings show that the optimum use of medical centers\u2019 potential and the corresponding decisions result in a more resilient health system and cost reduction. A further outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is also prevented by shortening the commuting distance for patients and avoiding the increasing congestion in the medical centers. Also, the managerial insights show that establishing and evenly distributing camps and quarantine stations within the community and designing an efficient network for patients with different symptoms result in the optimum use of the potential capacity of medical centers and a decrease in the rate of bed shortage in the hospitals. Another insight drawn is that an efficient allocation of the suspect and definite cases to the nearest screening and care centers makes it possible to prevent the disease carriers from commuting within the community and increase the coronavirus transmission rate.",

In this study, we assess the competitive interactions between the Omicron variant and other prominent variants (Alpha, Beta, and Delta) on a social network, considering both single infection and coinfection states. Using the SIRS model, we simulate the progression of these variants and analyze their impact on infection rates, mortality, and overall disease burden. Our findings demonstrate that the Alpha and Beta strains exhibit comparable contagion levels, with the Alpha strain displaying higher infection and mortality rates. Moreover, the Delta strain emerges as the most prevalent and virulent strain, surpassing the other variants. When introduced alongside the less virulent Omicron strain, the Delta strain results in higher infection and mortality rates. However, the Omicron strain's dominance leads to an overall increase in disease statistics. Remarkably, our study highlights the efficacy of the Omicron variant in supplanting more virulent strains and its potential role in mitigating the spread of infectious diseases. The Omicron strain demonstrates a competitive advantage over the other variants, suggesting its potential to reduce the severity of the disease and alleviate the burden on healthcare systems. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring and understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 variants, as they can inform effective prevention and mitigation strategies, particularly with the emergence of variants that possess a relative advantage in controlling disease transmission.",

We systematically compare the exact solution with mean-field predictions obtained from a treelike random rewiring of the network, which preserves only the degree sequence. Our results demonstrate a nontrivial interplay between degree heterogeneity, correlations and network topology, which can significantly alter both the percolation threshold and the critical exponents predicted by the mean-field.

To do so, we extend the cavity method to study networks where nodes have heterogeneous transmissibility. We find that vaccination with partial transmission still provides herd immunity and show how the herd immunity threshold depends upon the assortativity between nodes of different transmissibility. In addition, we study the impact of social distancing via bond percolation and show that percolation targeting links between nodes of high transmissibility can reduce the risk of an epidemic greater than targeting links between nodes of high degree. Finally, we extend recent methods to compute the distributional equations of risk in populations with heterogeneous transmissibility and show how targeted social distancing measures may reduce overall risk greater than untargeted vaccination campaigns, by comparing the effect of random and targeted strategies of node and link deletion on the risk distribution.",

We show that even for strongly heterogeneous distributions, the GUC always appears at a finite threshold and its formation is characterized by homogeneous mean-field percolation critical exponents. The threshold is a nonmonotonic function of connectivity: robustness is maximized by networks with finite optimal average degree. We also show that if the average degree is large enough, a damaged phase appears, characterized by the existence of a GDC, bounded by two distinct percolation transitions. The birth and the dismantling of the GDC are characterized by standard percolation critical exponents in networks, except for the dismantling in scale-free networks where new critical exponents are found.

Its effectivity can be quantified by modifying the standard methodology for analyzing percolation and connectivity of contact networks. We apply this framework to networks with varying degree distributions, numbers of application users, and probabilities of quarantine failures. Further, we study structured populations with homophily and heterophily and the possibility of degree-targeted application distribution. Our results are based on a combination of explicit simulations and mean-field analysis. They indicate that there can be major differences in the epidemic size and epidemic probabilities which are equivalent in the normal susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) processes. Further, degree heterogeneity is seen to be especially important for the epidemic threshold but not as much for the epidemic size. The probability that tracing leads to quarantines is not as important as the application adoption rate. Finally, both strong homophily and especially heterophily with regard to application adoption can be detrimental. Overall, epidemic dynamics are very sensitive to all of the parameter values we tested out, which makes the problem of estimating the effect of digital contact tracing an inherently multidimensional problem.",

Because of the heterogeneous structure of a complex network, the probability of a node to be an articulation point or the probability of an edge to be a bredge will not be homogeneous across the network. We therefore analyze full distributions of articulation point probabilities as well as bredge probabilities, using a message-passing or cavity approach to the problem. Our methods allow us to obtain these distributions both for large single instances of networks and for ensembles of networks in the configuration model class in the thermodynamic limit, through a single unified approach. We also evaluate deconvolutions of these distributions according to degrees of the node or the degrees of both adjacent nodes in the case of bredges. We obtain closed form expressions for the large mean degree limit of Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks. Moreover, we reveal and are able to rationalize a significant amount of structure in the evolution of articulation point and bredge probabilities in response to random bond removal. We find that full distributions of articulation point and bredge probabilities in real networks and in their randomized counterparts may exhibit significant differences even where average articulation point and bredge probabilities do not. We argue that our results could be exploited in a variety of applications, including approaches to network dismantling or to vaccination and islanding strategies to prevent the spread of epidemics or of blackouts in process networks.",
