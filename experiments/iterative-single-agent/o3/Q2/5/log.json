Classical theory attributes epidemic termination to two---not mutually exclusive---mechanisms:  (i) the decline of the infectious population through recovery or removal, and (ii) exhaustion of the susceptible pool.  We investigate both mechanisms analytically using network--aware extensions of the Kermack–McKendrick susceptible--infectious--removed (SIR) framework and corroborate the insights with stochastic simulations on a $1000$--node Erdős--Rényi contact network.  Two scenarios are contrasted: a moderate basic reproduction number ($R_{0}\\approx 2.5$) and a high $R_{0}\\approx10$.  Results show that when $R_{0}$ is moderate, transmission ceases after the susceptible fraction decays below the critical value $1/R_{0}$, yet a substantial susceptible reservoir ($\\approx 21\\%$) remains; the epidemic fades primarily because the infectious count dwindles.  Under high $R_{0}$ almost the entire susceptible population is depleted ($<0.5\\%$ remaining), rendering susceptible exhaustion the dominant terminating factor.  The study quantifies epidemic duration, peak prevalence, final size, and temporal evolution of the effective reproduction number $R(t)$, providing clear operational criteria that discriminate between the two termination routes.\n\\end{abstract}\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe cessation of an epidemic---often referred to as ``breaking the chain of transmission''---occurs when the average number of secondary infections generated by a primary case falls below one.  This drop in the time--dependent reproductive number $R(t)$ can arise from a shrinking infectious population, the depletion of susceptibles, or both.  Distinguishing the dominant cause is pivotal: if decline in infectives is sufficient, resources can be channelled toward case management, whereas if susceptible exhaustion is required, population--wide measures such as immunisation may be indispensable.  While deterministic compartmental models\\cite{Anderson1991} and their stochastic counterparts\\cite{Hoog1979} provide threshold criteria, explicit network structure further modulates these dynamics by constraining who contacts whom.  Here, we blend analytical derivations coupled to degree--based network moments with large--scale stochastic simulation to answer the posed question: ``Does an epidemic terminate because infectives vanish or because susceptibles are exhausted?''.\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Network Construction}\nA static Erdős--Rényi (ER) graph $G(N, p)$ with $N=1000$ nodes and edge probability $p=0.01002$ (yielding mean degree $\\langle k\\rangle \\approx 10$) was generated.  The degree distribution (Figure~\\ref{fig:degree}) has second moment $\\langle k^{2}\\rangle \\approx 109$, giving a mean excess degree $q=(\\langle k^{2}\\rangle-\\langle k\\rangle)/\\langle k\\rangle \\approx9.93$.\n \\begin{figure}[!t]\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{degree_dist.png}\n \\caption{Degree distribution of the simulated Erdős--Rényi network ($N=1000$, $\\langle k\\rangle \\approx10$).}\n \\label{fig:degree}\n \\end{figure}\n\\subsection{Epidemic Model}\nWe adopted a network--based SIR process where a susceptible node $S$ acquires infection through contact with an infectious neighbor $I$ at rate $\\beta$, and infectious nodes recover at rate $\\gamma$.  The basic reproduction number on a configuration network is $R_{0}=\\beta q/\\gamma$.\n\\subsection{Parameterisation and Scenarios}\nTwo parameter sets were explored (Table~\\ref{tab:params}).  Recovery was fixed at $\\gamma=1/7\\;\\text{d}^{-1}$, reflecting a 7--day infectious period.  Scenario~A set $\\beta$ such that $R_{0}\\approx2.5$, typical of seasonal influenza, whereas Scenario~B used a four--fold larger $\\beta$ to obtain $R_{0}\\approx10$, mimicking highly transmissible pathogens.\n\\begin{table}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Model parameters}\n\\begin{tabular}{lccc}\n\\hline\nScenario & $\\beta$ (d$^{-1}$) & $\\gamma$ (d$^{-1}$) & $R_{0}$ \\\\\n\\hline\nA (moderate) & $0.0359$ & $0.1429$ & 2.5 \\\\\nB (high) & $0.1436$ & $0.1429$ & 10.0 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{tab:params}\n\\end{table}\n\\subsection{Initial Condition and Simulation}\nOne percent of nodes were randomly seeded infectious; the remainder were susceptible.  Simulations employed the \\textit{fastGEMF} Gillespie engine with stopping time $160$~days and single realisation per scenario (sufficient because variance is low in $N=10^{3}$ ER networks with large $R_{0}$).  State counts were saved every $\\Delta t=0.1$~days.\n\\section{Analytical Expectations}\nThe canonical threshold theorem\\cite{Anderson1991} states that infections decline once $S(t)<S_{c}=\\gamma N/\\beta=N/R_{0}$.  Defining $x(t)=S(t)/N$, $y(t)=I(t)/N$, the deterministic equations satisfy $dy/dt=\\gamma y (R_{0} x-1)$.  Hence, $y$ peaks when $x=1/R_{0}$ and thereafter decays exponentially with rate $\\gamma(1-R_{0}x)$.  If $R_{0}$ is modest, $x$ needs to drop only moderately below one for $dy/dt<0$, leaving many susceptibles uninfected.  Conversely, if $R_{0}\\gg1$, $x$ must fall to near zero, implying near--total susceptible depletion.  These contrasting regimes motivate the two scenarios.\n\\section{Results}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:traj} contrasts temporal trajectories.  Key metrics are summarised in Table~\\ref{tab:metrics}.\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n \\centering\n \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\linewidth]{results-11.png}\n \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\linewidth]{results-12.png}\n \\caption{Stochastic trajectories.

Thereafter, $I$ decays while $S$ stabilises at $\\approx 209$.  Because a fifth of the population remains susceptible, the epidemic terminates mainly because the infectious pool has fallen below the level required to sustain $R(t)\\ge1$.\n\\subsection{Scenario B: Susceptible Exhaustion Dominates}\nWith $R_{0}\\approx10$, the critical threshold is $S_{c}=100$.  The epidemic blitzes through the population, leaving only four susceptibles.  Infectives vanish rapidly once $S\\ll S_{c}$, but the near--complete depletion of susceptibles is the proximate cause.\n\\section{Discussion}\nThese findings reconcile two ostensibly conflicting narratives:  epidemics can stop without infecting everyone, yet under sufficiently high transmissibility or dense contact structure, susceptible exhaustion becomes inevitable.  Network heterogeneity modulates $R_{0}$ through $q$; interventions that lower either $\\beta$ or $q$ shift the system from Scenario~B--type to Scenario~A--type termination, opening a quantitative pathway to evaluate control policies.  Limitations include the single realisation per scenario and the choice of an ER graph; scale--free or clustered networks may exhibit longer tails of infection persistence.\n\\section{Conclusion}\nAnalytical theory predicts, and stochastic simulation confirms, that an epidemic ceases when $R(t)<1$, achievable either by dwindling infectives or by depleting susceptibles.  Which mechanism dominates is governed primarily by $R_{0}$ relative to network structure.  For pathogens with moderate $R_{0}$ on sparse networks, large residual susceptible pools persist, whereas highly transmissible agents on similar networks extinguish only after near--total susceptible exhaustion.  These insights emphasise the dual levers of control: reducing transmissibility and preserving susceptibles via vaccination.\n\\section*{References}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\\bibitem{Anderson1991} R.
