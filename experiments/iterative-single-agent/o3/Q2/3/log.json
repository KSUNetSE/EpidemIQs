Classical deterministic theory attributes epidemic fade--out either to an intrinsic decline in the number of infectious individuals when the basic reproduction number $\\mathcal R_0<1$, or to the exhaustion of susceptible hosts once the fraction of susceptibles drops below $1/\\mathcal R_0$ for initially super--critical outbreaks ($\\mathcal R_0>1$).  Using a joint analytical and simulation--based study on a static Erd\\\"os--R\\'enyi contact network ($N=1000$, $\\langle k\\rangle\\approx10$), we quantify both mechanisms.  Two parameterisations of an SIR process are considered: (i) a sub--critical scenario ($\\mathcal R_0=0.8$) and (ii) a super--critical scenario ($\\mathcal R_0=3.0$).  Exact stochastic network simulations with FastGEMF corroborate the deterministic prediction that fade–out in the first case is governed by the monotonic decline of infectives while ample susceptibles remain ($S_{\\infty}\\approx95\\%$), whereas in the second case it is the depletion of susceptibles that reverses infection growth and terminates transmission ($S_{\\infty}\\approx15\\%$).  The results provide quantitative evidence for both mechanisms and highlight their dependence on $\\mathcal R_0$ and network structure.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nBreaking an epidemic chain of transmission can occur for fundamentally different reasons.  In sub--critical settings where the basic reproduction number $\\mathcal R_0<1$, each infectious individual, on average, transmits to fewer than one new host; therefore the number of infectives $I(t)$ decays exponentially and the outbreak dies out mainly because the pool of infectives vanishes \\cite{AndersonMay1991}.  Conversely, if $\\mathcal R_0>1$ the incidence initially grows, but transmission eventually ceases once the susceptible fraction $S(t)/N$ falls below $1/\\mathcal R_0$ \\cite{KermackMcKendrick1927}.  Although these principles are well established in homogeneous--mixing theory, their manifestation on realistic contact networks warrants reassessment \\cite{PastorSatorras2001,DiLauro2021}.\n\nThis paper re--examines the fade--out mechanisms analytically and validates them with stochastic simulations of an SIR process on an Erd\\\"os--R\\'enyi (ER) network.  We show quantitatively how the two routes to termination emerge under different $\\mathcal R_0$ regimes and provide measurable criteria, derived from network moments, that link the microscopic infection rate $\\beta$ to an emergent $\\mathcal R_0$.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Network Construction}\nA static ER graph with $N=1000$ nodes was generated using connection probability $p=0.01$.  Python NetworkX implementation yielded mean degree $\\langle k\\rangle=9.976$ and second moment $\\langle k^{2}\\rangle=108.922$.  The adjacency matrix was stored in compressed sparse row (CSR) format (\\texttt{network.npz}).\n\n\\subsection{Mechanistic Model}\nAn SIR compartmental model with states $\\{S,I,R\\}$ was encoded in FastGEMF.  Edges mediate infection at per--contact rate $\\beta$; infectives recover at rate $\\gamma=0.2\\,\\text{d}^{-1}$.  Two parameter sets were defined:\n\\begin{itemize}\n \\item \\textbf{Sub--critical}: $\\mathcal R_0=0.8$, implying $\\beta= \\mathcal R_0\\,\\gamma / q$ where $q=(\\langle k^{2}\\rangle-\\langle k\\rangle)/\\langle k\\rangle$.  This gives $\\beta=0.0161$.\n \\item \\textbf{Super--critical}: $\\mathcal R_0=3.0$, hence $\\beta=0.0605$.\n\\end{itemize}\nInitial conditions place $1\\%$ of nodes at random in $I$ and the remainder in $S$.\n\n\\subsection{Analytical Framework}\nFor a deterministic SIR model on a well--mixed population the infection dynamic obeys\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{\\mathrm d I}{\\mathrm d t}=\\beta \\frac{S}{N} I-\\gamma I=I\\bigl(\\beta \\tfrac{S}{N}-\\gamma\\bigr).\\label{eq:dIdt}\n\\end{equation}\nThe sign of the bracket determines epidemic growth.  Two cases arise:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n \\item[1)] $\\mathcal R_0=\\beta/\\gamma <1$.  Then $\\beta S/N-\\gamma<0$ for all $t$ because $S\\le N$.  Hence $I(t)$ decays monotonically and extinction results from the \\emph{decline of infectives}.  A large susceptible residue remains: $S_{\\infty}\\approx N$.\n \\item[2)] $\\mathcal R_0>1$.  The term in brackets is initially positive until $S(t)$ falls below $N/\\mathcal R_0$.  At that time, $I(t)$ reaches its peak, after which Eq.~\\eqref{eq:dIdt} becomes negative.  Fade--out therefore requires \\emph{susceptible depletion}.  Final size solves $R_{\\infty}/N=1-\\exp(-\\mathcal R_0 R_{\\infty}/N)$ \\cite{DiekmannHeesterbeek2000}.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThese conclusions are expected to remain qualitatively valid on locally tree--like networks when $\\beta$ is rescaled through the excess degree $q$ \\cite{PastorSatorras2001}.\n\n\\subsection{Simulation Protocol}\nFastGEMF version~0.2.0 was used to run one stochastic realisation per parameter set for an equivalent horizon of $160$~days.  Code is available in \\texttt{simulation--12.py}.  Temporal compartment counts were exported to \\texttt{results--11.csv} (sub--critical) and \\texttt{results--12.csv} (super--critical) together with plotted trajectories (Figures~\\ref{fig:sub}--\\ref{fig:super}).\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\subsection{Trajectory Characteristics}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:sub} shows that with $\\mathcal R_0=0.8$ infections decline immediately; the peak number of infectives is only $12$ individuals, reached on day~2.  The susceptible pool remains virtually intact ($S_{\\infty}=953$).\n\nBy contrast, Figure~\\ref{fig:super} illustrates explosive initial growth for $\\mathcal R_0=3.0$, peaking at $244$ infectives on day~13, after which incidence collapses as susceptibles are exhausted.  Only $15\\%$ of nodes stay uninfected ($S_{\\infty}=147$).\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\columnwidth]{results-11.png}\n  \\caption{Sub--critical scenario ($\\mathcal R_0=0.8$).  Infection declines monotonically while susceptibles remain abundant.}\n  \\label{fig:sub}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\columnwidth]{results-12.png}\n  \\caption{Super--critical scenario ($\\mathcal R_0=3.0$).  Fade--out occurs after susceptible depletion reduces the effective reproduction number below unity.}\n  \\label{fig:super}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Quantitative Metrics}\nTable~\\ref{tab:metrics} summarises key indicators extracted from the CSV files.\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Simulation metrics.}\n\\label{tab:metrics}\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccc}\n\\toprule\nScenario & $I_{\\max}$ & $t_{\\max}$ [d] & $R_{\\infty}$ & $S_{\\infty}$\\\\\n\\midrule\nSub--critical & 12 & 2.0 & 47 & 953\\\\\nSuper--critical & 244 & 13.1 & 853 & 147\\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nThe deterministic analysis predicts two distinct routes to epidemic extinction depending on the initial reproduction number.  Stochastic network simulations confirm these predictions quantitatively.\n\nIn the sub--critical case, the driving mechanism is the inherent reproductive deficit ($\\mathcal R_0<1$) causing $I(t)$ to decay irrespective of susceptible availability.  Policy implications include that modest non--pharmaceutical interventions capable of pushing $\\mathcal R_0$ marginally below one are sufficient to stop transmission without immunising the majority.\n\nIn the super--critical regime, the epidemic can only be halted after substantial immunisation through infection or vaccination has reduced the susceptible fraction below $1/\\mathcal R_0$.  The final size closely matches the root of the transcendental equation for $R_{\\infty}$, demonstrating that classical final size theory retains power on sparse random networks when parameters are appropriately renormalised.\n\nLimitations include the small network size and absence of clustering; empirical networks with strong heterogeneity may lower the herd immunity threshold via selective removal of high--degree nodes \\cite{DiLauro2021}.  Future work will explore these effects.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nAnalytical derivations and stochastic network simulations jointly show that epidemic fade--out can occur either because infectives decline when $\\mathcal R_0<1$, or because susceptible depletion reduces the effective reproduction number below unity in initially super--critical outbreaks.  Recognising which mechanism dominates in a given context is vital for designing proportionate control measures and vaccination targets.\n\n\\section*{Appendix}\nPython scripts and data files are available in the accompanying repository.
