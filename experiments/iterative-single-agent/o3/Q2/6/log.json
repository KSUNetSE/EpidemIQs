We examine both processes analytically using the classic susceptible--infectious--removed (SIR) model on static contact networks and corroborate the theory with stochastic simulations on an Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi graph of $N=1000$ nodes.  Scenario~1 sets $R_0=0.8$ (subcritical), illustrating fade--out driven by rapid infective decline; Scenario~2 sets $R_0=3.0$ (supercritical) and demonstrates epidemic arrest through depletion of susceptibles once their fraction falls below $1/R_0$.  The supercritical outbreak infects $90\\%$ of the population before cessation, while the subcritical outbreak terminates after <\\,9\\% cumulative infection.  The findings, consistent with threshold results reported in \\cite{Aguas2020,Bjornstad2002}, underline the importance of both parameters and population structure in epidemic control.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nQuantifying the conditions that halt an epidemic is central to infectious--disease control.  Classical mass--action theory posits two principal routes to interruption of transmission: (i) intrinsic decline of infectives when the basic reproduction number \\mbox{$R_0<1$}, and (ii) susceptible depletion that drives the effective reproduction number \\mbox{$R_e(t)=R_0 S(t)/N$} below one even when \\mbox{$R_0>1$}.  Recent analyses of measles \\cite{Bjornstad2002} and SARS--CoV--2 \\cite{Aguas2020} emphasise how heterogeneity in contacts accelerates the second mechanism, lowering herd--immunity thresholds.  We revisit these principles on explicit contact networks, contrasting the two cessation mechanisms both analytically and via stochastic simulation.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Network Construction}\nA static Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi (ER) graph \\mbox{$G(N,p)$} with $N=1000$ nodes and edge probability \\mbox{$p=\\bar{k}/(N-1)$} was generated, targeting mean degree $\\bar{k}=10$.  The resulting network exhibits \\mbox{$\\langle k\\rangle=9.98$} and second moment \\mbox{$\\langle k^{2}\\rangle=108.9$}.  Moments were required to calibrate per--contact transmission rates.\n\n\\subsection{Compartmental Dynamics}\nWe employed an SIR process with discrete states $\\{S,I,R\\}$ and transitions\n\\begin{align}\nS + I &\\xrightarrow{\\beta} I + I,\\\\\nI &\\xrightarrow{\\gamma} R.\n\\end{align}\nRecovery was fixed at $\\gamma=0.2\\;\\text{day}^{-1}$ (mean infectious period $5$~days).  For each scenario, $\\beta$ was set from the desired $R_0$ using the network expression \\mbox{$\\beta = R_0\\,\\gamma/q$} where \\mbox{$q=(\\langle k^{2}\\rangle-\\langle k\\rangle)/\\langle k\\rangle$} is the mean excess degree.\n\n\\subsection{Scenarios and Initial Conditions}\n\\begin{itemize}\n \\item \\textbf{Scenario~1 (Subcritical).} $R_0=0.8$ yields $\\beta=0.0161$.  One percent of nodes were initialised as infectious, the remainder susceptible.\n \\item \\textbf{Scenario~2 (Supercritical).} $R_0=3.0$ gives $\\beta=0.0605$ with identical initial seeding.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection{Simulation Engine}\nA discrete--time Gillespie approximation was implemented in \\textsc{Python} (Appendix~A).  For each scenario, a single realisation over $180$~days was executed; outputs were saved as CSV and plotted (Figures~\\ref{fig-sim1}--\\ref{fig-sim2}).\n\n\\section{Analytical Results}\nFor homogeneous mixing the infective population obeys\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{dI}{dt}=\\beta S I - \\gamma I = I\\,\\gamma (R_e-1).\n\\end{equation}\nThus $I$ grows if $R_e>1$.  Two regimes emerge:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n \\item \\emph{Intrinsic Fade--out} ($R_0<1$).  Because $R_e=R_0 S/N<1$ for all $t$, $I(t)$ decays monotonically; the outbreak fails to take off.\n \\item \\emph{Susceptible Depletion} ($R_0>1$).  Initial growth occurs, but $R_e$ crosses unity when $S(t)=N/R_0\\equiv S_c$.  Integrating the SIR equations gives the final size relation $R(\\infty)=N- S(\\infty)$ where $\\ln S(\\infty)+R_0\\, R(\\infty)/N=\\ln S(0)$.  For $R_0=3$ and our seed, $S(\\infty)\\approx 0.1N$.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\section{Simulation Results}\nKey metrics extracted from simulation outputs are summarised in Table~\\ref{tab-metrics}.\n\n\\begin{table}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Epidemic metrics from stochastic simulations.}\n\\label{tab-metrics}\n\\begin{tabular}{@{}lcccc@{}}\n\\toprule\nScenario & Peak $I$ & Peak time (d) & Final size & Duration (d) \\\\ \\midrule\n1: $R_0=0.8$ & 19 & 12 & 88 & 59 \\\\ \n2: $R_0=3.0$ & 307 & 16 & 899 & 56 \\\\ \\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{results-11.png}\n\\caption{Temporal dynamics for Scenario~1 ($R_0=0.8$).

The epidemic peaks near day~16 and ceases after susceptibles fall below $S_c=N/R_0$.}\n\\label{fig-sim2}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nThe subcritical scenario demonstrates that when each infectious individual spawns on average less than one secondary case, transmission chains are self--limiting regardless of the susceptible pool.  Our network simulation reinforces this: the largest infectious count reached 19, and only $8.8\\%$ of the population experienced infection.\n\nConversely, the supercritical scenario mirrors historical outbreaks where susceptible exhaustion, not forceful removal of infectives, halts spread.  Despite an early explosion (peak $I=307$), the process stopped when susceptibles fell to $\\approx 0.1N$, matching the theoretical threshold $S_c$.  This aligns with empirical observations that measles and SARS--CoV--2 epidemics often taper once herd immunity is approached \\cite{Bjornstad2002,Aguas2020}.\n\nNetwork topology influences both mechanisms.  High variance in degree (captured by $q$) lowers the transmission rate needed to achieve a given $R_0$, implying that control measures targeting high--degree nodes may preferentially raise the threshold for the second mechanism.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nThe chain of transmission can break either because infectives dwindle when $R_0<1$ or because susceptible depletion reduces $R_e$ below one when $R_0>1$.  Analytical derivations and stochastic network simulations converge on this dual paradigm.  Public health interventions may therefore pursue either strategy: reducing $R_0$ via non--pharmaceutical interventions or vaccination, or accelerating safe depletion of susceptibles through immunisation to achieve herd immunity.\n\n\\section*{Appendix A: Code Availability}\nPython scripts and data are provided in the project repository; key routines are listed below.\n\\begin{verbatim}\nsimulate(beta, gamma, G, days, initial_infected_frac)\n\\end{verbatim}\n\n\\section*{References}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\n\\bibitem{Bjornstad2002} O.~Bjørnstad, B.~Finkenstädt, and B.~Grenfell, ``Dynamics of measles epidemics: Estimating scaling of transmission rates using a time series SIR model,'' \\\\textit{Ecological Monographs}, vol.~72, pp.~169--184, 2002.\n\n\\bibitem{Aguas2020} R.~Aguas, R.~M.~Corder, J.~G.~King, \\\\textit{et al.}, ``Herd immunity thresholds for SARS-CoV-2 estimated from unfolding epidemics,'' \\\\textit{medRxiv}, 2020, doi:10.1101/2020.07.23.20160762.\n\n\\end{thebibliography}\n\n\\end{document}",
