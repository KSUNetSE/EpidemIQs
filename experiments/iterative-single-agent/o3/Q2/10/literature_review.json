                    "abstract": "Background. The COVID-19 pandemic is of great interest to researchers due to high mortality and a very negative impact to the world economy. A detailed scientific analysis of the phenomenon is yet to come, but the public is already interested in the problems of duration of the epidemic, the expected number of patients, where and when the pandemic started. Correct simulation of the pandemic dynamics needs complicated mathematical models and many efforts for unknown parameters identification. In this article, preliminary estimates for many countries and world will be presented, summarized and discussed. Objective. We will estimate the epidemic characteristics for USA, Germany, UK, the Republic of Korea and in the world with the use of SIR simulations and compare them with the results obtained before for Italy, Spain, France, the Republic of Moldova, Ukraine and Kyiv. The hidden periods, epidemic durations, final numbers of cases and quarantine measures will be discussed. Methods. In this study we use the known SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model for the dynamics of the epidemic, the known exact solution of the linear differential equations and statistical approach developed before. Results. The optimal values of the SIR model parameters were identified with the use of statistical approach for epidemic dynamics in USA, Germany, UK, the Republic of Korea, and in the world. The actual number of cases and the number of patients spreading the infection versus time were calculated. The hidden periods, durations and final sizes of the epidemic were evaluated. In particular, the pandemic began in China no later than October, 2019. If current trends continue, the end of the pandemic should be expected no earlier than March 2021, the global number of cases will exceed 5 million. A simple method for assessing the risk of premature weakening of quarantines is proposed. Conclusions. The SIR model and statistical approach to the parameter identification are helpful to make some reliable estimations for the epidemic dynamics, e.g., the real time of the outbreak, final size and duration of the epidemic and the number of persons spreading the infection versus time. This information will be useful to regulate the quarantine activities and to predict the medical and economic consequences of the pandemic.",

Many \u2018structured models\u2019 capture aspects of the contact pattern through an underlying network or a mixing matrix. An important observation in unstructured models of a disease that confers immunity is that once a fraction 1-1/R0\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$1-1/{\\mathcal {R}}_0$$\\end{document} has been infected, the residual susceptible population can no longer sustain an epidemic. A recent observation of some structured models is that this threshold can be crossed with a smaller fraction of infected individuals, because the disease acts like a targeted vaccine, preferentially immunising higher-risk individuals who play a greater role in transmission. Therefore, a limited \u2018first wave\u2019 may leave behind a residual population that cannot support a second wave once interventions are lifted. In this paper, we set out to investigate this more systematically. While networks offer a flexible framework to model contact patterns explicitly, they suffer from several shortcomings: (i) high-fidelity network models require a large amount of data which can be difficult to harvest, and (ii) very few, if any, theoretical contact network models offer the flexibility to tune different contact network properties within the same framework. Therefore, we opt to systematically analyse a number of well-known mean-field models. These are computationally efficient and provide good flexibility in varying contact network properties such as heterogeneity in the number contacts, clustering and household structure or differentiating between local and global contacts. In particular, we consider the question of herd immunity under several scenarios. When modelling interventions as changes in transmission rates, we confirm that in networks with significant degree heterogeneity, the first wave of the epidemic confers herd immunity with significantly fewer infections than equivalent models with less or no degree heterogeneity. However, if modelling the intervention as a change in the contact network, then this effect may become much more subtle. Indeed, modifying the structure disproportionately can shield highly connected nodes from becoming infected during the first wave and therefore make the second wave more substantial. We strengthen this finding by using an age-structured compartmental model parameterised with real data and comparing lockdown periods implemented either as a global scaling of the mixing matrix or age-specific structural changes. Overall, we find that results regarding (disease-induced) herd immunity levels are strongly dependent on the model, the duration of the lockdown and how the lockdown is implemented in the model.",

                    "abstract": "The spread of SARS-CoV-2 through direct transmission (person-to-person) has been the focus of most studies on the dynamics of COVID-19. The efficacy of social distancing and mask usage at reducing the risk of direct transmission of COVID-19 has been studied by many researchers. Little or no attention is given to indirect transmission of the virus through shared items, commonly touch surfaces and door handles. The impact of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces and in the environment, on the dynamics of COVID-19 remain largely unknown. Also, the current increase in the number of cases despite the strict non-pharmaceutical interventions suggests a need to study the indirect transmission of COVID-19 while incorporating testing of infected individuals as a preventive measure. Assessing the impact of indirect transmission of the virus may improve our understanding of the overall dynamics of COVID-19. We developed a novel deterministic susceptible-exposedinfected- removed-virus-death compartmental model to study the impact of indirect transmission pathway on the spread of COVID-19, the sources of infection, and prevention/control. We fitted the model to the cumulative number of confirmed cases at episode date in Toronto, Canada using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimization algorithm. We studied the effect of indirect transmission on the epidemic peak, peak time, epidemic final size and the effective reproduction number, based on different initial conditions and at different stages. Our findings revealed an increase in cases with indirect transmission. Our work highlights the importance of implementing additional preventive and control measures involving cleaning of surfaces, fumigation, and disinfection to lower the spread of COVID-19, especially in public areas like the grocery stores, malls and so on. We conclude that indirect transmission of SARS-CoV- 2 has a significant effect on the dynamics of COVID-19, and there is need to consider this transmission route for effective mitigation, prevention and control of COVID-19 epidemic.",

Both the case that the resistance may be the same for all hosts and the case that it is distributed among the host population are considered. In addition to the familiar threshold behavior of the final size of the epidemic with respect to a basic reproductive number, an Allee effect is generated with respect to the final cumulative force of infection exerted by the initial infectives. This offers a deterministic explanation of why geographic areas that appear to be epidemiologically similar have epidemic outbreaks of quite different severity.",

We demonstrate the veracity of the KMES using the Google Residential Mobility Measure to accurately project case data from the Covid 19 pandemic and we derive many useful, but previously unknown, analytical expressions for characterizing and managing an epidemic. These include expressions for the viral load, the final size, the effective reproduction number, and the time to the peak in infections. The KMES can also be cast in the form of a step function system response to the input of new infections; and that response is the time series of total infections. Since the publication of Kermack and McKendricks seminal paper (1927), thousands of authors have utilized the Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered (SIR) approximations; expressions putatively derived from the integro-differential equations to model epidemic dynamics. Implicit in the use of the SIR approximation are the beliefs that there is no closed form solution to the integro-differential equations, and that the approximation is a special case which adequately reproduces the dynamics of the integro-differential equations mapped onto the physical world. However, the KMES demonstrates that the SIR approximations are not adequate representations of the integro-differential equations, and we therefore suggest that the KMES obsoletes the need for the SIR approximations by providing not only a new mathematical perspective, but a new understanding of epidemic dynamics.",

The discrete time version is as general and flexible as its continuous-time counterpart, and contains numerous compartmental models as special cases. In contrast to the continuous time version, the discrete time version of the model is very easy to implement computationally, and thus promises to become a powerful tool for exploring control scenarios for specific infectious diseases. To demonstrate the potential, we investigate numerically how the incidence-peak size depends on model ingredients. We find that, with the same reproduction number and initial speed of epidemic spread, compartmental models systematically predict lower peak sizes than models that use a fixed duration for the latent and infectious periods.",

The second relation p(\u221e) \u22481\u2212exp(\u2212(R0\u22121)/0.60) is the relation between p(\u221e), the final size of the disaster defined by the ratio of the total infected people to the population of the society,and the basic reproduction number, R0, which is the number of persons infected by the transmission of the pathogen from one infected person during the infectious time. The third relation 1/\u03c4end=1/\u03c4inf\u2212(1\u2212p(\u221e))/\u03c4trans gives the decay time constant \u03c4end at the ending stage of the epidemic.

In 1927, Kermack and McKendrick [41] derived the celebrated threshold theorem, which is one of the key results in epidemiology. It predicts \u2013 depending on the transmission potential of the infection \u2013 the critical fraction of susceptibles in the population that must be exceeded if an epidemic is to occur. This was followed by the classic work of Bartlett [9], who examined models and data to expose the factors that determine disease persistence in large populations. Arguably, the first landmark book on mathematical modeling of epidemiological systems was published by Bailey [8] which led in part to the recognition of the importance of modeling in public health decision making [7]. Given the diversity of infectious diseases studied since the middle of the 1950s, an impressive variety of epidemiological models have been developed.A comprehensive review of them would be both beyond the scope of the present chapter and of limited interest.

The critical community size separating the two regimes was ;300 000-500 000. We develop a model, the TSIR (Time-series Suscep- tible-Infected-Recovered) model, that can capture both endemic cycles and episodic out- breaks in measles. The model includes the stochasticity inherent in the disease transmission (giving rise to a negative binomial conditional distribution) and random immigration. It is thus a doubly stochastic model for disease dynamics. It further includes seasonality in the transmission rates. All parameters of the model are estimated on the basis of time series data on reported cases and reconstructed susceptible numbers from a set of cities in England and Wales in the prevaccination era (1944-1966). The 60 cities analyzed span a size range from London (3.3 3 10 6 inhabitants) to Teignmouth (10 500 inhabitants). The dynamics of all cities fit the model well. Transmission rates scale with community size, as expected from dynamics adhering closely to frequency dependent transmission (''true mass action''). These rates are further found to reveal strong seasonal variation, corresponding to high transmission during school terms and lower transmission during the school holidays. The basic reproductive ratio, R0, is found to be invariant across the observed range of host community size, and the mean proportion of susceptible individuals also appears to be constant. Through the epidemic cycle, the susceptible population is kept within a 3% interval. The disease is, thus, efficient in ''regulating'' the susceptible population\u2014even in small cities that undergo recurrent epidemics with frequent extinction of the disease agent. Recolonization is highly sensitive to the random immigration process. The initial phase of the epidemic is also stochastic (due to demographic stochasticity and random immigration). However, the epidemic is nearly ''deterministic'' through most of the growth and decline phase.",

Effectively such models treat infection and immunity as binary variables. We show here that considering immunity as a continuous variable instead of binary and incorporating factors that bring about small changes in immunity lead to qualitatively different epidemiological predictions. The small immunity effects (SIE) constitute cross immunity by other infections, small increments in immunity by sub clinical exposures and slow decay in the absence of repeated exposure. The SIE model explains many epidemiological patterns observed during the Covid-19 pandemic that are not adequately explained by conventional models. In the SIE model repeated waves are possible without the need for new variants. Peak and decline of a wave much before reaching herd immunity threshold, low level apparently stable existence of the pathogen, new surges after variable and unpredictable gaps, new surge after vaccinating majority of population are the common features of the pandemic mimicked by simulations using the SIE model. The model further shows complex interactions of different interventions that can be contextually synergistic as well as antagonistic. As a result, interventions intended to arrest the transmission are not always effective and can turn counterproductive under some conditions. Interventions that are beneficial in the short run can be potentially hazardous in the long run. In the absence of empirical estimates of many parameters, the model may not be useful to make quantitative predictions at this stage but it certainly challenges traditional wisdom and currently held beliefs behind non-pharmaceutical interventions recommended to control the epidemic. We also suggest testable predictions to differentiate between the causal logic of the SIE model against the prevalent explanations for the same observed phenomena.",

                    "abstract": "As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads, the susceptible subpopulation declines causing the rate at which new infections occur to slow down. Variation in individual susceptibility or exposure to infection exacerbates this effect. Individuals that are more susceptible or more exposed tend to be infected and removed from the susceptible subpopulation earlier. This selective depletion of susceptibles intensifies the deceleration in incidence. Eventually, susceptible numbers become low enough to prevent epidemic growth or, in other words, the herd immunity threshold is reached. Here we fit epidemiological models with inbuilt distributions of susceptibility or exposure to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks to estimate basic reproduction numbers (R_0) alongside coefficients of individual variation (CV) and the effects of containment strategies. Herd immunity thresholds are then calculated as 1-(1/R_0 )^(1/((1+CV^2 ) )) or 1-(1/R_0 )^(1/((1+2CV^2 ) )), depending on whether variation is on susceptibility or exposure. Our inferences result in herd immunity thresholds around 10-20%, considerably lower than the minimum coverage needed to interrupt transmission by random vaccination, which for R_0 higher than 2.5 is estimated above 60%. We emphasize that the classical formula, 1-1/R_0 , remains applicable to describe herd immunity thresholds for random vaccination, but not for immunity induced by infection which is naturally selective. These findings have profound consequences for the governance of the current pandemic given that some populations may be close to achieving herd immunity despite being under more or less strict social distancing measures.",

The approach is due to Kermack and McKendrick, dating from 1927. Despite the many citations, the true contents of their work is essentially unknown. On top of that, their continuous-time model takes the mathematical form of a renewal equation, and only a few experts can handle such equations numerically. Here, we establish that the discrete-time version is equally general and flexible and, yet, is very simple to parametrize on the basis of data and to implement computationally. This makes the framework highly suitable for studying control scenarios for epidemic diseases such as COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to numerous mathematical models for the spread of infection, the majority of which are large compartmental models that implicitly constrain the generation-time distribution. On the other hand, the continuous-time Kermack\u2013McKendrick epidemic model of 1927 (KM27) allows an arbitrary generation-time distribution, but it suffers from the drawback that its numerical implementation is rather cumbersome. Here, we introduce a discrete-time version of KM27 that is as general and flexible, and yet is very easy to implement computationally. Thus, it promises to become a very powerful tool for exploring control scenarios for specific infectious diseases such as COVID-19. To demonstrate this potential, we investigate numerically how the incidence-peak size depends on model ingredients. We find that, with the same reproduction number and the same initial growth rate, compartmental models systematically predict lower peak sizes than models in which the latent and the infectious period have fixed duration.",

                    "abstract": "Mathematical modelling of the spread of epidemics has been an interesting challenge in the field of epidemiology. The SIR Model proposed by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 is a prototypical model of epidemiology. However, it has its limitations. In this paper, we show two independent ways of generalizing this model, first one if the vaccine isn't discovered or ready to use and the next one, if the vaccine is discovered and ready to use. In the first part, we have pointed out a major over-simplification, i.e., assumption of variation of the time derivatives of the variables with the linear powers of the individual variables and introduced two new parameters to incorporate further non-linearity to the number of infected people in the model. As a result of this, we showed how this additional nonlinearity, in the newly introduced parameters, can bring a significant shift in the peak time of infection,i.e., time at which infected population reaches maximum. We show that in special cases, even we can get a transition from epidemic to a non-epidemic stage of a particular infectious disease. We further study one such special case and treat as a problem of phase transition. Then, we investigate all the necessary parameters of this phase transition, like order parameter and critical exponent. We observed $O_p \\sim (q_c-q)^{\\beta}$. In the second part, we incorporate in the model, a consideration of artificial herd immunity and show how we can decrease the peak time of infection with a subsequent decrease in the maximum number of infected people. Finally, we estimate a critical value of the rate of vaccination by a statistical method such that we proposed a way of possible eradication of the epidemic in a short time by effectively providing the vaccine to a population.",

We demonstrate the veracity of the KMES using the Google Residential Mobility Measure to accurately project case data from the Covid 19 pandemic and we derive many useful, but previously unknown, analytical expressions for characterizing and managing an epidemic. These include expressions for the viral load, the final size, the effective reproduction number, and the time to the peak in infections. The KMES can also be cast in the form of a step function system response to the input of new infections; and that response is the time series of total infections. Since the publication of Kermack and McKendricks seminal paper (1927), thousands of authors have utilized the Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered (SIR) approximations; expressions putatively derived from the integro-differential equations to model epidemic dynamics. Implicit in the use of the SIR approximation are the beliefs that there is no closed form solution to the integro-differential equations, and that the approximation is a special case which adequately reproduces the dynamics of the integro-differential equations mapped onto the physical world. However, the KMES demonstrates that the SIR approximations are not adequate representations of the integro-differential equations, and we therefore suggest that the KMES obsoletes the need for the SIR approximations by providing not only a new mathematical perspective, but a new understanding of epidemic dynamics.",
