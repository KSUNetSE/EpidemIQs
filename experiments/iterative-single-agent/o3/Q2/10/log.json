Analytical and Network--Based Simulation Evidence on the Roles of Declining Infectives Versus Depletion of Susceptibles}\n\n\\author{Anonymous Author}\n\\maketitle\n\n\\begin{abstract}\nThe cessation of epidemic transmission is commonly attributed either to the exhaustion of susceptible hosts or to a decline in the number of infectious individuals.  This study dissects these two mechanisms using the classical susceptible--infectious--removed (SIR) framework on a static Erd\\\"{o}s--R\\'enyi network of $N=1000$ individuals.  Analytical derivations demonstrate that the epidemic halts whenever the instantaneous reproduction number $R_{t}=\\beta S/\\gamma$ falls below unity, which can occur via (i) diminishing prevalence $I(t)$ at reproduction numbers only marginally above one, or (ii) progressive loss of susceptibles that forces $R_{t}<1$.  Stochastic simulations with two transmissibility settings ($R_{0}=1.5$ and $R_{0}=5$) corroborate the theory: in the low--transmission scenario the chain breaks primarily by infected depletion (peak $I=66$ and $49\\%$ susceptibles never infected), whereas under higher transmissibility transmission terminates through near--exhaustion of susceptibles (peak $I=420$ and $3.4\\%$ susceptibles spared).  We quantify epidemic duration, peak size, final size, and doubling time, concluding that both pathways are theoretically consistent and practically observable, with their dominance governed by the basic reproduction number, contact structure, and intervention timing.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe classical study of Kermack and McKendrick \\cite{KM1927} established that an epidemic ends when the growth rate of infectives becomes negative, but the relative importance of waning prevalence versus susceptible depletion has remained a didactic point of debate.  Contemporary network theory enriches this discussion by allowing heterogeneous contact patterns, yet the termination criteria remain governed by the same mass--action terms \\cite{Diekmann2021}.  This paper revisits the question through both analytical reasoning and individual--based simulation on a static random network, providing quantitative evidence for the two competing mechanisms of chain interruption.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Network Construction}\nA static Erd\\\"{o}s--R\\'enyi (ER) graph $G(N,p)$ with $N=1000$ and mean degree $\\langle k \\rangle \\approx10$ ($p=\\langle k \\rangle / (N-1)$) was generated (see \\texttt{network\\_construction.py}).  The resulting first and second degree moments were $\\langle k \\rangle =9.99$ and $\\langle k^{2}\\rangle =109.63$, yielding a mean excess degree $q=(\\langle k^{2}\\rangle-\\langle k \\rangle)/\\langle k \\rangle=9.99$.\n\n\\subsection{SIR Model and Parameterisation}\nWe employed a continuous--time SIR process mapped onto the network edges.  Let $\\beta$ denote per--contact infection rate and $\\gamma=0.2\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$ the recovery rate ($5$--day infectious period).  For a desired $R_{0}$ we set $\\beta=R_{0}\\,\\gamma/q$.  Two scenarios were considered: (i) $R_{0}=1.5$ ($\\beta=0.030$), and (ii) $R_{0}=5$ ($\\beta=0.101$).  Ten randomly selected nodes (1\\%) were seeded as infectious.\n\n\\subsection{Simulation Procedure}\nAn event–driven approximation with time–step $\\Delta t=0.1\\,$days was implemented (\\texttt{simulation-1.py}).  At each step, susceptible nodes become infectious with probability $1-e^{-\\beta I_{n}\\,\\Delta t}$ where $I_{n}$ is the count of infectious neighbours, and infectives recover with probability $1-e^{-\\gamma\\,\\Delta t}$.  The simulation stopped when $I(t)=0$ or $t=160\\,$days.  Outputs were written to \\texttt{results-11.csv} (scenario~1) and \\texttt{results-12.csv} (scenario~2); trajectories were plotted in Figures~\\ref{fig:s1}--\\ref{fig:s2}.\n\n\\subsection{Analytical Criterion}\nFor the deterministic SIR equations\n\\begin{equation}\n\\dot I = \\beta \\frac{S}{N} I - \\gamma I=\\gamma I \\left(R_{t}-1\\right),\\qquad R_{t}=\\frac{\\beta S}{\\gamma},\n\\end{equation}\ntransmission ceases when $R_{t}<1$ or $I\\rightarrow0$.  With small $R_{0}$ or strong interventions, $I(t)$ may fall to zero while $S(t)$ remains well above $S_{c}=\\gamma/\\beta$.  Conversely, for $R_{0}\\gg1$, $S(t)$ declines past $S_{c}$, making $R_{t}<1$ regardless of the residual $I$.  Thus both mechanisms are embodied in the same threshold condition.\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\subsection{Scenario~1: $R_{0}=1.5$}\nPeak prevalence was modest ($66$ cases at $t=19.3$~days) and the epidemic ended after $120$~days with $49.3\\%$ of the population never infected.  The doubling time during early growth was $10.2$~days.  Figure~\\ref{fig:s1} illustrates how $I(t)$ dwindles to zero before susceptibles approach exhaustion.\n\n\\subsection{Scenario~2: $R_{0}=5$}\nHigher transmissibility produced a rapid surge (peak $I=420$ at $t=9.5$~days), exhausting $96.6\\%$ of susceptibles and extinguishing in $47$~days.  Early doubling time shortened to $2.0$~days.  The chain of transmission broke when $S$ fell below $S_{c}=\\gamma/\\beta\\approx1.98$ individuals, essentially equivalent to depletion of susceptibles (Figure~\\ref{fig:s2}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.9\\columnwidth]{results-11.png}\n\\caption{Temporal dynamics for scenario~1 ($R_{0}=1.5$).

When $R_{0}$ is only slightly above unity, stochastic fade--out or early interventions can render $I(t)$ negligible before $S$ is appreciably reduced, reproducing the pattern in scenario~1.  In contrast, large $R_{0}$ values propel the epidemic until herd immunity ($S<S_{c}$) is achieved, as in scenario~2.  Network heterogeneity modulates but does not overturn these principles; highly connected nodes speed susceptible depletion, lowering the critical prevalence required for shutdown.\n\nPractically, interventions that lower $\\beta$ (masking, distancing) shift $S_{c}$ upward, favouring the \\emph{infective--decline} termination, thereby sparing susceptibles.  Vaccination removes susceptibles pre\\,emptively, mimicking the \\emph{susceptible--depletion} mechanism but under controlled conditions.  The results emphasise that both routes are valid; policy should aim for the former to minimise cumulative infections.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nBreaking the chain of transmission arises when the effective reproduction number drops below one, achievable either by reducing infectious prevalence or by depleting susceptible hosts.  Analytical derivation and network simulations confirm that the dominant pathway depends on baseline transmissibility and contact structure.  Targeted interventions that reduce $\\beta$ can engineer epidemic termination via declining infectives, thus minimising the total attack rate.\n\n\\bibliographystyle{IEEEtran}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\\bibitem{KM1927} W.~O.
