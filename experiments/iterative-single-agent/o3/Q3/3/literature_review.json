This peculiar connectivity provides an ideal environment for the spreading of infective agents. Here we show that the random uniform immunization of individuals does not lead to the eradication of infections in all complex networks. Namely, networks with scale-free properties do not acquire global immunity from major epidemic outbreaks even in the presence of unrealistically high densities of randomly immunized individuals. The absence of any critical immunization threshold is due to the unbounded connectivity fluctuations of scale-free networks. Successful immunization strategies can be developed only by taking into account the inhomogeneous connectivity properties of scale-free networks. In particular, targeted immunization schemes, based on the nodes' connectivity hierarchy, sharply lower the network's vulnerability to epidemic attacks.",

Specifically, the paper deals with three competing virus systems (i.e., tri-virus systems). First, we show that a tri-virus system, unlike a bi-virus system, is not a monotone dynamical system. Using the Parametric Transversality Theorem, we show that, generically, a tri-virus system has a finite number of equilibria and that the Jacobian matrices associated with each equilibrium are nonsingular. The endemic equilibria of this system can be classified as follows: a) single-virus endemic equilibria (also referred to as the boundary equilibria), where precisely one of the three viruses is alive; b) 2-coexistence equilibria, where exactly two of the three viruses are alive; and c) 3-coexistence equilibria, where all three viruses survive in the network. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition that guarantees local exponential convergence to a boundary equilibrium. Further, we secure conditions for the nonexistence of 3-coexistence equilibria (resp. for various forms of 2-coexistence equilibria). We also identify sufficient conditions for the existence of a 2-coexistence (resp. 3-coexistence) equilibrium. We identify conditions on the model parameters that give rise to a continuum of coexistence equilibria. More specifically, we establish i) a scenario that admits the existence and local exponential attractivity of a line of coexistence equilibria; and ii) scenarios that admit the existence of, and, in the case of one such scenario, global convergence to, a plane of 3-coexistence equilibria.",

Since the system is also monotone, it turns out that the typical behavior of the system is convergence to some equilibrium point.

For example, bond percolation models considering population heterogeneity have been used to provide insights into disease spread and misinformation control. However, most of these studies focus on single-layer contact networks. In our work, we examine how the spreading process is impacted by the existence of multiple contact network layers, considering layer-dependent population heterogeneity from a principled, mathematical perspective. Using SIR dynamics, we derive expressions for three key epidemiological measures: the probability of emergence, the epidemic threshold, and the expected epidemic size. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our analytical results match the numerical results near-perfectly in the finite node regime. These findings reveal the interplay among the multi-layer network structures, transmission dynamics, and population heterogeneity in determining the final outcome of the spreading process. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of layer-dependent population heterogeneity and identify important factors for developing effective and economical layer-oriented spreading control strategies. Overall, our work provides insights into developing and analyzing mitigation and control strategies for disease spread and information diffusion across multi-layer complex networks.",

Epidemic modeling and simulation are at the core of the healthcare efforts that are underway to assert some level of control over the spreading and the treatment of a pathogen. In this milieu, this paper describes a stochastic dynamic model to simulate the spreading of infectious diseases. We present the equations that describe the system dynamics, their adjoint systems, and their optimal control characterization by means of the discrete-system extension of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. This derivation is presented in two different cases: a vaccination policy and a combined vaccination-treatment approach. We show the behavior of such models via numerical simulations using the forward-backward sweep procedure.

Memory effects in the pattern of interactions among individuals are also known to affect how diffusive and spreading phenomena take place. In this paper we analyze the combined effect of these two ingredients on epidemic dynamics on networks. We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models on the recently introduced activity-driven networks with memory. By means of an activity-based mean-field approach, we derive, in the long-time limit, analytical predictions for the epidemic threshold as a function of the parameters describing the distribution of activities and the strength of the memory effects. Our results show that memory reduces the threshold, which is the same for SIS and SIR dynamics, therefore favoring epidemic spreading. The theoretical approach perfectly agrees with numerical simulations in the long-time asymptotic regime. Strong aging effects are present in the preasymptotic regime and the epidemic threshold is deeply affected by the starting time of the epidemics. We discuss in detail the origin of the model-dependent preasymptotic corrections, whose understanding could potentially allow for epidemic control on correlated temporal networks.",

In particular, we focus on how the epidemic threshold of the SIR model is affected by the heterogeneity of nodal activities and the memory strength in temporal and static regimes, respectively. While strong ties (memory) between nodes inhibit the spread of epidemic to be localized, the heterogeneity of nodal activities enhances it to be globalized initially. Since the epidemic threshold of the SIR model is very sensitive to the degree distribution of nodes in static networks, we test the SIR model on the modified ADTNs with the possible set of the activity exponents and the memory exponents that generates the same degree distributions in temporal networks. We also discuss the role of spatiotemporal scaling properties of the largest cluster and the maximum degree in the epidemic threshold. It is observed that the presence of highly active nodes enables to trigger the initial spread of epidemic in a short period of time, but it also limits its final spread to the entire network. This implies that there is the trade-off between the spreading time of epidemic and its outbreak size. Finally, we suggest the phase diagram of the SIR model on ADTNs and the optimal condition for the spread of epidemic under the circumstances.",

Here we investigate the impact of this ubiquitous feature by studying the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic models on activity driven networks with and without memory (i.e., Markovian and non-Markovian). We show that while memory inhibits the spreading process in SIR models, where the epidemic threshold is moved to larger values, it plays the opposite effect in the case of the SIS, where the threshold is lowered. The heterogeneity in tie strengths, and the frequent repetition of connections that it entails, allows in fact less virulent SIS-like diseases to survive in tightly connected local clusters that serve as reservoir for the virus. We validate this picture by evaluating the threshold of both processes in a real temporal network. Our findings confirm the important role played by non-Markovian network dynamics on dynamical processes.",

In addition, heterogeneity of interaction strengths and individual\u2019s memory have been proved to be important to affect network evolution in the area of complex networks. Based on a recent extension of the activity-driven modeling framework, i.e. activity-driven model with attractiveness, where individuals are characterized by their activities and attractiveness, we propose a new temporal network model by considering individuals\u2019 memory. Similar to the previous network model, we also investigate heterogeneous distributions and different correlations between the two variables (activity and attractiveness). By numerical simulations, we illustrate the impact of memory on epidemic spreading processes unfolding on the proposed model. We find that, when individuals\u2019 attractiveness is fixed, memory does not cause dramatic change on the epidemic threshold in the SIR process, but it inhibits the epidemic spreading by reducing the infected ratio. While for the SIS process, in the case of uncorrelated and positive correlations between the two variables, memory facilitates the epidemic outbreaks by shrinking the epidemic threshold. When the two variables are negatively correlated, memory does not take obvious impact on the epidemic threshold. Besides, for the two processes unfolding on the network with and without memory, the propagation threshold decreases with the enhancement of the positive correlation, however, it almost does not get much influence from the negative correlation strength. It indicates that for the individuals with same activity, more attractive individuals will promote the disease spread. The findings deepen our understanding of the role of individuals\u2019 memory and their attractiveness in the epidemic spreading process.",

Recently, it has been shown that stationary and pairwise interactions have limitations in describing inter-individual interactions , and thus, the introduction of higher-order representation is significant. To this end, we present a new two-layer activity-driven network epidemic model, which considers the partial mapping relationship among nodes across two layers and simultaneously introduces simplicial complexes into one layer, to investigate the effect of 2-simplex and inter-layer mapping rate on epidemic transmission. In this model, the top network, called the virtual information layer, characterizes information dissemination in online social networks, where information can be diffused through simplicial complexes and/or pairwise interactions. The bottom network, named as the physical contact layer, denotes the spread of infectious diseases in real-world social networks. It is noteworthy that the correspondence among nodes between two networks is not one-to-one but partial mapping. Then, a theoretical analysis using the microscopic Markov chain (MMC) method is performed to obtain the outbreak threshold of epidemics, and extensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are also carried out to validate the theoretical predictions. It is obviously shown that MMC method can be used to estimate the epidemic threshold; meanwhile, the inclusion of simplicial complexes in the virtual layer or introductory partial mapping relationship between layers can inhibit the spread of epidemics.

                    "paper_title": "Network-based analysis of stem cells differentiation",
                    "abstract": "Motivation and Objectives Understanding the real developmental stage of reprogrammed stem cells is still a demanding task for researchers in regenerative medicine. In fact, developmental biology is in need of methods that would accurately predict the developmental stage reached by cells cultured in non standard conditions, such as the induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs). Bioinformatics approaches would be extremely useful for assessing the pluripotency status of the cells, and thus, their potential use in the clinics for repairing malfunctioning tissues and organs. To this aim, several works have recently demonstrated the utility of applying dimensionality reduction techniques to genome wide expression data (Aiba et al, 2009). As we have shown (Zagar et al, 2011), these methods can be successfully used to predict the developmental stage of cells by mapping their transcriptional profile to a one-dimensional ruler, that we named differentiation scale. The proposed approach was also useful for identifying reduced subsets of genes that drive each developmental stage (Mulas et al, 2012). A crucial issue in this field is the integration of the findings extracted from the data with the available knowledge coming from biological databases. For instance, genes that are surrounded by a high number of selected genes in the protein-protein interaction networks should be included in the analysis (Nitsch et al, 2010). In this work, we developed a network-based pipeline for analyzing temporal gene expression data coming from embryonic stem cells differentiation. The results highlighted the transcriptional changes occurring during development and allowed identifying known markers as well as novel gene candidates potentially involved in the regulation of stem cell differentiation. Methods Stem cell differentiation is characterized by an intense transcription activity where a number of transcription factors regulates the gene expression of specific targets (Zagar et al., 2011). These transcriptional changes can be observed by analyzing the genome-wide expression profiles of m genes at n different samples along differentiation. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) may be used to assign a real number p(s) to a sample s based on its expression profile. The result of this inference is a set of real numbers that can be placed in a 1D ruler, the differentiation scale. To construct a more robust predictive model, we combined the expression values from six data sets on embryonic stem cells differentiation provided by Gene Expression Omnibus with a meta-analysis method named Merging. Thanks to this approach, we obtained an integrated scale where a new uncharacterized sample can be projected to uncover its real stage of development with respect to the normal dynamics. Reduced subsets of genes specifically activated in different stages of differentiation were identified by means of a novel gene selection procedure that assigns to each gene a score proportional to its PCA-inferred weight in the stage s and its expression value. In order to obtain a complete picture of the gene transcription in each stage, we exploited the biological knowledge available through the STRING database (Szklarczyk et al., 2011). STRING imports and combines data gathered from heterogeneous sources to provide information about known and predicted protein-protein associations. A confidence score is also assigned to each predicted association. In this work, we developed and analyzed a set of STRING-based networks, one for each stage of development, by applying the following procedure: 1. Network building. For each stage-specific list of genes, we mapped the gene symbols to their corresponding protein ids provided by the UNIPROT database. This step allowed retrieving the protein associations predicted by STRING, that we used to build a set of gene networks. A pair of genes in each network was connected if the confidence score of their proteins association in STRING exceeded a selected global threshold. 2. Topological analysis. The developmental stages measured in the considered experiments were grouped into three phases according to the clusters of projections that we observed in the differentiation scale. We analyzed the similarity of the networks obtained for each phase in terms of their topological properties. First, in order to take into account the number of common gene links in the networks, we computed the median jaccard index between networks of different phases. Moreover, to quantitatively characterize the importance of the nodes in our networks, we considered a topological index known as betweenness centrality. This measure is defined as the number of shortest paths that go through a considered node, and represents the influence of that node in the flow of information within the network. Nodes with a high betweenness typically make possible the communications in the network among clusters of nodes characterized by high internal connectivity. The betweenness values of the genes present in each phase were used to compare the different developmental phases and to identify the most relevant genes in each network. 3. Biological analysis. The expanded lists of genes obtained with STRING were further analyzed in light of the knowledge on developmental processes reported in the literature. Different works have recently pointed out the existence of a set of specific genes that are responsible for a particular pluripotency status of the cell (Zuccotti et al., 2011). First, in order to evaluate the effect of the network-based procedure on the gene selection, we compared the list of genes retrieved with our approach with the known markers. The analysis then focused on identifying the most biologically significant genes for each differentiation phase. The importance of a gene in a developmental stage is represented by its role in the transcriptional regulatory circuitry of the process and is best quantified by its betweenness centrality value. We therefore looked for sets of significant genes among the bottlenecks of the developed networks. Phase-specific important genes were identified applying a selection procedure based on a global threshold value. For each phase, we determined a list of characterizing genes by extracting those that were contained in more than the 60% of the total number of networks present in the phase. All genes included in at least one phase-specific list were assigned the median of all their betweenness centrality values. We then considered the distribution of such median values and computed the 95th percentile, which was assumed as the threshold. Finally, from each phase-specific gene list all genes whose betweenness centrality value exceeded the threshold were extracted. Results and Discussion TThe results of the presented procedure confirmed that a transcriptional wave is active during differentiation and influences the topological properties of the networks. While the analysis of the Jaccard index showed no significant phase characterization in terms of common edges, a phase comparison based on betweenness similarity highlighted instead a distance between the first phase and the last stages (Table1). The biological analysis, i.e. the study of the expanded lists of genes in light of knowledge on developmental processes reported in the literature, identified 53 known markers included in at least one network. In particular, a number of known key genes retrieved with this method, such as Pou5f1, Nanog, Klf4, Sox2, were not previously selected by the data-driven procedure based on their expression profiles. This result confirmed how network-based approaches can integrate experimental findings contributing to the identification of significant genes, whose importance is due to the crucial role they play in the regulation of the global network. Gene characterization based on betweenness centrality selected a higher number of genes (24) in the first phase if compared to the others (11 and 9 genes for the second and the last phase, respectively), confirming a distinction of the early stages, where the majority of transcriptional changes are known to occur. Known markers as well as novel yet uncharacterized genes were identified. Starting from these results, future experiments will be focused on the application of network-based prioritization procedures, that would help to automatically retrieve the most significant genes in the networks.

We build a theory for the critical behavior of susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemics in the vicinity of the critical threshold on the activity-driven model of temporal networks. We find that the persistence of links in the network leads to increasing recovery rates reducing the threshold. Dynamic correlations (coming from being close to infected nodes increases the likelihood of infection) drive the threshold in the opposite direction.

We discuss the different limits of the two approaches, indicating the parameter regions where the correlated threshold collapses onto the uncorrelated case. Our analytical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the model. The temporal percolation concept can be fruitfully applied to study epidemic spreading on temporal networks. We show in particular how the susceptible-infected-removed model on an activity-driven network can be mapped to the percolation problem up to a time given by the spreading rate of the epidemic process. This mapping allows us to obtain additional information on this process, not available for previous approaches.",

By using a mean-field approach, we derive an analytical estimate of the epidemic threshold for susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic models for a general adaptive strategy, which strongly depends on the correlations between activity and attractiveness in the susceptible and infected states. We focus on strong social distancing, implementing two types of quarantine inspired by recent real case studies: an active quarantine, in which the population compensates the loss of links rewiring the ineffective connections towards nonquarantining nodes, and an inactive quarantine, in which the links with quarantined nodes are not rewired. Both strategies feature the same epidemic threshold but they strongly differ in the dynamics of the active phase. We show that the active quarantine is extremely less effective in reducing the impact of the epidemic in the active phase compared to the inactive one and that in the SIR model a late adoption of measures requires inactive quarantine to reach containment.",

In most cases, network structure is treated as either static or time-varying, supposing the whole network is observed in the same time window. In this paper, we consider the epidemics spreading on a network which has both static and time-varying structures. Meanwhile, the time-varying part and the epidemic spreading are supposed to be of the same time scale. We introduce a static and activity-driven coupling (SADC) network model to characterize the coupling between the static (\"strong\") structure and the dynamic (\"weak\") structure. Epidemic thresholds of the SIS and SIR models are studied using the SADC model both analytically and numerically under various coupling strategies, where the strong structure is of homogeneous or heterogeneous degree distribution. Theoretical thresholds obtained from the SADC model can both recover and generalize the classical results in static and time-varying networks. It is demonstrated that a weak structure might make the epidemic threshold low in homogeneous networks but high in heterogeneous cases. Furthermore, we show that the weak structure has a substantive effect on the outbreak of the epidemics. This result might be useful in designing some efficient control strategies for epidemics spreading in networks.",

As a proper way to describe the multiple connections among people in reality, multiplex network, a set of nodes interacting through multiple sets of edges, has attracted much attention. In this paper, to explore the coupled dynamical processes, a multiplex network with two layers is built. Specifically, the information spreading layer is a time varying network generated by the activity driven model, while the contagion layer is a static network. We extend the microscopic Markov chain approach to derive the epidemic threshold of the model. Compared with extensive Monte Carlo simulations, the method shows high accuracy for the prediction of the epidemic threshold. Besides, taking different spreading models of awareness into consideration, we explored the interplay between epidemic spreading with awareness spreading. The results show that the awareness spreading can not only enhance the epidemic threshold but also reduce the prevalence of epidemics. When the spreading of awareness is defined as susceptible-infected-susceptible model, there exists a critical value where the dynamical process on the awareness layer can control the onset of epidemics; while if it is a threshold model, the epidemic threshold emerges an abrupt transition with the local awareness ratio \u03b1 approximating 0.5. Moreover, we also find that temporal changes in the topology hinder the spread of awareness which directly affect the epidemic threshold, especially when the awareness layer is threshold model. Given that the threshold model is a widely used model for social contagion, this is an important and meaningful result. Our results could also lead to interesting future research about the different time-scales of structural changes in multiplex networks.",

One of the key assumptions of ADNs is the lack of preferential connections among individuals. This assumption hinders the application of ADNs to several realistic scenarios where some contacts persist in time, rather than intermittently activate. Here, we examine an improved modeling framework that superimposes an ADN to a static backbone network, toward the integration of persistent contacts with time-varying connections. To demonstrate the interplay between the ADN and the static backbone, we investigate the effect of behavioral changes on the disease dynamics. In this framework, each individual may adapt his/her activity as a function of the health status, thereby adjusting the relative weight of time-varying versus static links. To illustrate the approach, we consider two classes of backbone networks, Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi and random regular, and two disease models, SIS and SIR. A general mean-field theory is established for predicting the epidemic threshold, and numerical simulations are conducted to shed light on the role of network parameters on the epidemic spreading and estimate the epidemic size.",

As an important part of this field, intervention against information diffusion processes is attracting ever-increasing attention from network and control engineers. In particular, it is urgent to design intervention schemes for the coevolutionary dynamics between information diffusion processes and coupled networks. For this purpose, we comprehensively study the problem of information diffusion intervention over static and temporal coupling networks. First, individual interactions are described by a modified activity-driven network (ADN) model. Then, we establish a novel node-based susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered\u2013susceptible (SIRS) model to characterize the information diffusion dynamics. On these bases, three synergetic intervention strategies are formulated. Second, we derive the critical threshold of the controlled-SIRS system via stability analysis. Accordingly, we exploit a spectral optimization scheme to minimize the outbreak risk or the required budget. Third, we develop an optimal control scheme of dynamically allocating resources to minimize both system loss and intervention expense, in which the optimal intervention inputs are obtained through optimal control theory and a forward\u2013backward sweep algorithm. Finally, extensive simulation results validate the accuracy of theoretical derivation and the performance of our proposed intervention schemes.",

In this paper we analyze the combined effect of these two ingredients on epidemic dynamics on networks. We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models on the recently introduced activity-driven networks with memory. By means of an activity-based mean-field approach, we derive, in the long-time limit, analytical predictions for the epidemic threshold as a function of the parameters describing the distribution of activities and the strength of the memory effects. Our results show that memory reduces the threshold, which is the same for SIS and SIR dynamics, therefore favoring epidemic spreading. The theoretical approach perfectly agrees with numerical simulations in the long-time asymptotic regime. Strong aging effects are present in the preasymptotic regime and the epidemic threshold is deeply affected by the starting time of the epidemics. We discuss in detail the origin of the model-dependent preasymptotic corrections, whose understanding could potentially allow for epidemic control on correlated temporal networks.",

Here we investigate the impact of this ubiquitous feature by studying the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic models on activity driven networks with and without memory (i.e., Markovian and non-Markovian). We find that memory inhibits the spreading process in SIR models by shifting the epidemic threshold to larger values and reducing the final fraction of recovered nodes. On the contrary, in SIS processes memory reduces the epidemic threshold and, for a wide range of disease parameters, increases the fraction of nodes affected by the disease in the endemic state. The heterogeneity in tie strengths, and the frequent repetition of strong ties it entails, allows in fact less virulent SIS-like diseases to survive in tightly connected local clusters that serve as reservoir for the virus. We validate this picture by studying both processes on two real temporal networks.",
