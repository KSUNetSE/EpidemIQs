    "question": " An epidemic has a reproductive number of R0 = 4, i.e. the mean excess degree of the effective network across which it is spreading is q = 4. Let's say the mean degree of this network is z = 3 and there are no degree correlations. You want to stop the epidemic by vaccinating people, using a vaccine that gives sterilizing immunity, so that a vaccinated person cannot transmit the disease. What proportion of the nodes do you need to vaccinate if you vaccinate random people? Also what proportion of nodes would you need to vaccinate if you are just vaccinating people who have a degree of exactly k = 10.address this question in both scenarios in analytcal and simulation approaches.",

    "next_plan": "I have completed detailed analytical derivations, built a configuration‐model network that satisfies the given degree statistics, computed the random-vaccination threshold (75 %) and the degree-10 targeted threshold (≈11 %), and performed stochastic SIR simulations on the constructed 10 000-node network for both vaccination strategies.  I now have all the quantitative outputs (network statistics, simulation traces, epidemic metrics) necessary to write the full IEEE-style LaTeX paper.  In the next step I will: 1) structure the LaTeX document, 2) insert all sections (Title, Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, References, Appendices), 3) embed the analytical derivations, 4) include simulation figures and tables (pointing to the saved PNG/CSV files), and 5) supply properly formatted bibitems for the literature used (percolation theory vaccination, configuration-model epidemic threshold, etc.).  After that, the process will be finished and I will output the complete compilable .tex source.",
