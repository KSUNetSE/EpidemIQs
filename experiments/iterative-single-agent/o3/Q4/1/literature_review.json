Based on the analysis of COVID-19 transmission, this paper divides the population into three categories: susceptible category, discovered disease category and immune category consisting of cure and death, and proposes two models: crowd contact network and contact network-based SIR model to simulate the transmission process of SIR; then absorbs the idea of synchronous update of cellular automaton model, and finally establishes a contact network-based SIR model whose members are affected by all passengers at the same time simulation model.

Services, are among many others, were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the years 2020 and 2021; but its impact on the TB transmission is not well understood. This retrospective population-based molecular and epidemiological cohort study aims to determine the pattern of TB transmission in Kuala Lumpur (an area with high population density, moderate TB burden and high rates of COVID-19 cases) for the cohort of Pulmonary TB (PTB) cases notified from 2020 until 2021 and factors associated with clustering or clear epidemiologic linkage. This study will be carried out from 2022 until 2024. The study will utilise comparative phylogenetic analysis to determine the degree of relatedness between different isolates, based on the genomes similarities, and overlay this with epidemiological, clinical and social network data to enhance understanding of the social-behavioural dynamics of TB transmission. Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) cultures will be genotyped using Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Unit Variable Number Tandem Repeats (MIRU-VNTR) and whole-genome sequence (WGS) for MTBC cluster isolates. Epidemiologic and genomic data will be overlaid on a social network constructed by means of interviews with patients, by using Social Network Analysis questionnaire, to determine the origins and transmission dynamics of the outbreak. The finding of this study would aid in the identification of TB transmission events, facilitating active case finding, TB screening, TB contact tracing, and the mapping of social contacts during critical period.

                    "abstract": "The growth of COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has turned into an unprecedented pandemic in the last century. It is crucial to identify superspreading nodes to prevent the pandemic\u2019s progress. Most available superspreader identification techniques consider only a single or few network metrics related to the complex network\u2019s topological structure. Furthermore, it is more challenging to determine influential spreaders from heterogeneous structures of networks. In a disease transmission network, the degree of heterogeneity is essential to locate the path of the infection spread. Therefore, it is required to have an extended degree of centrality to collect information from various neighborhood levels. This article presents an approach, namely, global structure influence (GSI), which considers network nodes\u2019 local and global influence. This method can gather information from multiple levels of the neighborhood. Evaluation of our proposed method is done by considering different types of networks, i.e., social networks, highly heterogeneous human contact networks, and epidemiological networks, and also by using the benchmark susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model. The GSI technique provides real-spreading dynamics across various network structures and has outperformed the baseline techniques with an average Kendall\u2019s $\\tau $ improvement range from 0.017 to 0.278. This study will help to identify the superspeaders in real applications, where pathogens spread quickly because of close contact, such as the recently witnessed COVID-19 pandemic.",

However, limited data on topological structural features has hindered in-depth studies. Existing research is based on snapshot analyses, preventing temporal investigations of network changes. Comparing network characteristics over time offers additional insights into transmission dynamics.

The present study aims to design a resilient health system to offer medical services to COVID-19 patients and prevent further disease outbreaks by social distancing, resiliency, cost, and commuting distance as decisive factors. It incorporated three novel resiliency measures (i.e., health facility criticality, patient dissatisfaction level, and dispersion of suspicious people) to promote the designed health network against potential infectious disease threats. Also, it introduced a novel hybrid uncertainty programming to resolve a mixed degree of the inherent uncertainty in the multi-objective problem, and it adopted an interactive fuzzy approach to address it. The actual data obtained from a case study in Tehran province in Iran proved the strong performance of the presented model. The findings show that the optimum use of medical centers\u2019 potential and the corresponding decisions result in a more resilient health system and cost reduction. A further outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is also prevented by shortening the commuting distance for patients and avoiding the increasing congestion in the medical centers. Also, the managerial insights show that establishing and evenly distributing camps and quarantine stations within the community and designing an efficient network for patients with different symptoms result in the optimum use of the potential capacity of medical centers and a decrease in the rate of bed shortage in the hospitals. Another insight drawn is that an efficient allocation of the suspect and definite cases to the nearest screening and care centers makes it possible to prevent the disease carriers from commuting within the community and increase the coronavirus transmission rate.",

In this study, we assess the competitive interactions between the Omicron variant and other prominent variants (Alpha, Beta, and Delta) on a social network, considering both single infection and coinfection states. Using the SIRS model, we simulate the progression of these variants and analyze their impact on infection rates, mortality, and overall disease burden. Our findings demonstrate that the Alpha and Beta strains exhibit comparable contagion levels, with the Alpha strain displaying higher infection and mortality rates. Moreover, the Delta strain emerges as the most prevalent and virulent strain, surpassing the other variants. When introduced alongside the less virulent Omicron strain, the Delta strain results in higher infection and mortality rates. However, the Omicron strain's dominance leads to an overall increase in disease statistics. Remarkably, our study highlights the efficacy of the Omicron variant in supplanting more virulent strains and its potential role in mitigating the spread of infectious diseases. The Omicron strain demonstrates a competitive advantage over the other variants, suggesting its potential to reduce the severity of the disease and alleviate the burden on healthcare systems. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring and understanding the dynamics of COVID-19 variants, as they can inform effective prevention and mitigation strategies, particularly with the emergence of variants that possess a relative advantage in controlling disease transmission.",

We systematically compare the exact solution with mean-field predictions obtained from a treelike random rewiring of the network, which preserves only the degree sequence. Our results demonstrate a nontrivial interplay between degree heterogeneity, correlations and network topology, which can significantly alter both the percolation threshold and the critical exponents predicted by the mean-field.

To do so, we extend the cavity method to study networks where nodes have heterogeneous transmissibility. We find that vaccination with partial transmission still provides herd immunity and show how the herd immunity threshold depends upon the assortativity between nodes of different transmissibility. In addition, we study the impact of social distancing via bond percolation and show that percolation targeting links between nodes of high transmissibility can reduce the risk of an epidemic greater than targeting links between nodes of high degree. Finally, we extend recent methods to compute the distributional equations of risk in populations with heterogeneous transmissibility and show how targeted social distancing measures may reduce overall risk greater than untargeted vaccination campaigns, by comparing the effect of random and targeted strategies of node and link deletion on the risk distribution.",

We show that even for strongly heterogeneous distributions, the GUC always appears at a finite threshold and its formation is characterized by homogeneous mean-field percolation critical exponents. The threshold is a nonmonotonic function of connectivity: robustness is maximized by networks with finite optimal average degree. We also show that if the average degree is large enough, a damaged phase appears, characterized by the existence of a GDC, bounded by two distinct percolation transitions. The birth and the dismantling of the GDC are characterized by standard percolation critical exponents in networks, except for the dismantling in scale-free networks where new critical exponents are found.

Its effectivity can be quantified by modifying the standard methodology for analyzing percolation and connectivity of contact networks. We apply this framework to networks with varying degree distributions, numbers of application users, and probabilities of quarantine failures. Further, we study structured populations with homophily and heterophily and the possibility of degree-targeted application distribution. Our results are based on a combination of explicit simulations and mean-field analysis. They indicate that there can be major differences in the epidemic size and epidemic probabilities which are equivalent in the normal susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) processes. Further, degree heterogeneity is seen to be especially important for the epidemic threshold but not as much for the epidemic size. The probability that tracing leads to quarantines is not as important as the application adoption rate. Finally, both strong homophily and especially heterophily with regard to application adoption can be detrimental. Overall, epidemic dynamics are very sensitive to all of the parameter values we tested out, which makes the problem of estimating the effect of digital contact tracing an inherently multidimensional problem.",

Because of the heterogeneous structure of a complex network, the probability of a node to be an articulation point or the probability of an edge to be a bredge will not be homogeneous across the network. We therefore analyze full distributions of articulation point probabilities as well as bredge probabilities, using a message-passing or cavity approach to the problem. Our methods allow us to obtain these distributions both for large single instances of networks and for ensembles of networks in the configuration model class in the thermodynamic limit, through a single unified approach. We also evaluate deconvolutions of these distributions according to degrees of the node or the degrees of both adjacent nodes in the case of bredges. We obtain closed form expressions for the large mean degree limit of Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks. Moreover, we reveal and are able to rationalize a significant amount of structure in the evolution of articulation point and bredge probabilities in response to random bond removal.

                    "abstract": "The incidental detection of adrenal masses by imaging is increasingly common in clinical practice owing to the ever-increasing use of cross-sectional imaging. Adrenal incidentalomas are found in about 5% of the population, and incidence increases with age (1). When an adrenal incidentaloma is detected, a systematic biochemical work-up is required to exclude excess secretion of adrenal hormones. In most cases, further radiologic work-up also ensues to exclude cancer. The mainstay management strategy for both overt hormone excess and cancer is adrenalectomy (2). Whereas most adrenal incidentalomas are benign nonfunctioning adrenal tumors (NFATs), about 15% are associated with hormone excess (3). A frequent finding in patients with adrenal incidentalomas is failure to suppress cortisol sufficiently after dexamethasone administration in the absence of typical clinical signs of cortisol excess (3), a condition often called subclinical Cushing syndrome or, as recently coined, mild autonomous cortisol excess (MACE). Generally, NFATs do not require surgery, whereas whether MACE adenomas should be removed is controversial (2, 4, 5), despite several studies suggesting that MACE may result in increased risk for cardiometabolic disease and death (68). Whether NFATs should undergo long-term follow-up is also debatable because of the substantial health economic burden and increased radiation exposure from potentially unnecessary repeated imaging. However, NFATs may be associated with increased cardiometabolic risk during follow-up (9, 10), and marked increases in adenoma size and development of clinically overt hormone excess over time have been reported (1114). Adrenal incidentaloma guidelines from the National Institutes of Health and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend repeated imaging and hormonal assessment for up to 5 years for tumors characterized at diagnosis as benign without overt hormonal hypersecretion (15, 16). Recent European guidelines discourage repeated imaging and hormonal assessment but recommend annual screening for overt Cushing syndrome in patients with MACE (2). These considerable differences in recommendations reflect the inadequacy of evidence that informs the follow-up of adrenal incidentalomas without an immediate indication for surgery. Most previous studies that addressed the natural history of NFAT and MACE were done in small cohorts of heterogeneous populations and used varied biochemical and radiologic assessments. Therefore, we sought to summarize the available literature and undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the natural history of NFAT and MACE adenomas to better guide their management. Our objectives were to determine the following: 1) the proportion of NFAT and MACE adenomas that increase in size, the degree of growth during follow-up, and the proportion of adenomas that show malignant transformation; 2) the proportion of NFAT and MACE adenomas that change their hormone production during follow-up; 3) the prevalence of hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular events in patients with NFAT or MACE at baseline and their incidence during follow-up; and 4) incident all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with NFAT or MACE during follow-up. Methods The meta-analysis was done according to a predesigned protocol (developed on 16 January 2017), which included methods and inclusion criteria and was developed in conformance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement (17). Data Sources and Searches We did a comprehensive electronic search of multiple databases, including Ovid MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus, for titles published between 1 January 1990 and 20 February 2019. This search strategy (Supplement Table 1) was designed and carried out by an experienced reference librarian (L.P.) with input from a study investigator with experience in conducting systematic reviews (I.B.). Controlled vocabulary supplemented with keywords was used to search for studies of the natural history of NFAT and MACE during follow-up. No language restriction was applied. We further searched bibliographies of included articles to identify any eligible studies that the electronic search may have missed. Supplement. Supplementary Material Study Selection We included original studies that evaluated populations of patients with NFAT, MACE, or both. Studies could be prospective or retrospective and had to include adults (aged 18 years) with NFAT or MACE (as defined by authors) (Supplement Table 2), have a sample size of at least 20 conservatively managed patients with at least 12 months of longitudinal follow-up, and report outcomes of interest at baseline and the end of follow-up. We excluded all nonoriginal studies and case reports. We included the following outcomes of interest for which we identified follow-up data for at least 100 patients: change in size of adrenal tumor, malignant transformation, change in hormone secretion, development of hypertension, obesity or weight gain, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular events, and death during follow-up (Supplement Table 3 defines these outcomes). We excluded outcomes with fewer than 100 identified patients, which included bone loss, vertebral fractures, and visceral fat accumulation. Six reviewers independently screened identified studies for eligibility. Conforming to the predefined inclusion criteria, they reviewed the titles and abstracts of identified studies in duplicate and removed all studies that did not fulfill the inclusion criteria at this stage. When reviewers disagreed, studies progressed to the next stage. In this phase, 2 reviewers independently screened full-text articles to assess eligibility for final inclusion, and discrepancies were resolved through discussion and consensus. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment Data extracted from each study included first author, year of publication, country where the study was done, participant demographics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study design, and prevalence of outcomes of interest at baseline and the end of follow-up. One investigator (Y.S.E.) combined all data extraction forms and resolved discrepancies at this stage by discussing them with the reviewers and referring back to the full-text articles. Pairs of reviewers independently assessed the quality of each included study. The modified NewcastleOttawa Scale for risk-of-bias assessment of observational studies was applied to assess the following domains (Supplement Table 4): selection (whether the cohort of patients with adrenal adenomas was representative), ascertainment (whether glucocorticoid autonomy and ascertainment of outcomes were described clearly), reporting (whether the proportion of patients affected by the studied outcome at baseline was reported clearly), causality (adequacy of follow-up, adequacy of the proportion of baseline patients assessed at follow-up, and similarity of outcome assessment between baseline and follow-up), and funding and conflicts of interest (whether information on funding and conflicts of interest was reported clearly) (18). One investigator (Y.S.E.) combined all of the quality assessment forms and resolved discrepancies by discussion with assessors. Data Synthesis and Analysis We analyzed only outcomes of interest for which the systematic review identified at least 100 patients. For continuous data, we used means and SDs from each study; when studies did not report these directly, we converted available data measures to means and SDs. We then pooled the mean differences from follow-up to baseline across the studies using the random-effects model, with heterogeneity estimated from the MantelHaenszel model. We estimated an exact binomial CI following the ClopperPearson procedures (19). We followed the FreemanTukey double arcsine transformation (20) to stabilize the variances. For dichotomous data, we calculated the event rate from each study group. We then pooled the log-transformed event rates using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models, with heterogeneity estimated from the MantelHaenszel model. All analyses were done using the random-effects model to produce proportion estimates and 95% CIs. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I 2 statistic, which represents the proportion of variability that is not attributable to chance. I 2 values more than 50% indicate substantial heterogeneity. Statistical analyses were done using OpenMeta [Analyst] (Brown University) (21). All values were 2-tailed, and a P value less than 0.05 was set as the threshold for statistical significance. Role of the Funding Source The funders had no role in study design, data collection or analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. Results Characteristics of Included Studies The database search yielded 1111 studies, in addition to 28 identified from bibliographies of screened articles. After screening, 32 studies were included in the analysis (Supplement Table 2). The PRISMA flow diagram outlines the numbers of studies screened, included, and excluded (Figure 1) (22). Of the 32 included studies (7, 10, 1214, 2349), 17 were retrospective and 15 were prospective. Eligible studies were mainly done in Europethat is, Italy (n= 13), Turkey (n= 4), Greece (n= 4), Finland (n= 2), the United Kingdom (n= 1), France (n= 1), Sweden (n= 1), and Spain (n= 1)but also in the United States (n= 2), Japan (n= 1), South Korea (n= 1), and Hong Kong (n= 1). Included studies reported follow-up outcomes of interest on 4121 patients (2873 with NFAT, 784 with MACE, and 464 with either NFAT or MACE; for the latter, it was not possible to disaggregate the baseline or follow-up outcomes on the basis of hormone assessment).

At zero temperature, many of these models exhibit a rigidity transition that separates two phases: a liquid phase and a solid (glassy) phase. This phenomenology is now well established but the theoretical understanding is still not complete. In this work we consider an exactly soluble mean field model for the rigidity transition which is based on an abstract mapping. We replace volume and surface functions by random non-linear functions of a large number of degrees of freedom forced to be on a compact phase space. We then seek for a configuration of the degrees of freedom such that these random non-linear functions all attain the same value. This target value is a control parameter and plays the role of the target cell shape in biological tissue models. Therefore we map the microscopic models of cells to a random continuous constraint satisfaction problem with equality constraints. We argue that at zero temperature, the rigidity transition corresponds to the satisfiability transition of the problem. We also characterize both the satisfiable (SAT) and unsatisfiable (UNSAT) phase. In the SAT phase, before reaching the rigidity transition, the zero temperature SAT landscape undergoes an replica symmetry breaking (RSB)/ergodicity breaking transition of the same type as the Gardner transition in amorphous solids. By solving the RSB equations we compute the SAT/UNSAT threshold and the critical behavior around it. In the UNSAT phase we also compute the average shape index as a function of the target one and we compare the thermodynamical solution of the model with the results of the numerical greedy minimization of the corresponding cost function.",

Because of the heterogeneous structure of a complex network, the probability of a node to be an articulation point or the probability of an edge to be a bredge will not be homogeneous across the network. We therefore analyze full distributions of articulation point probabilities as well as bredge probabilities, using a message-passing or cavity approach to the problem. Our methods allow us to obtain these distributions both for large single instances of networks and for ensembles of networks in the configuration model class in the thermodynamic limit, through a single unified approach. We also evaluate deconvolutions of these distributions according to degrees of the node or the degrees of both adjacent nodes in the case of bredges. We obtain closed form expressions for the large mean degree limit of Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks. Moreover, we reveal and are able to rationalize a significant amount of structure in the evolution of articulation point and bredge probabilities in response to random bond removal.

It is achieved using a cavity or message passing approach, which allows one to obtain the essential ingredient required for the solution, viz. a self-consistent determination of locally varying percolation probabilities. The cavity solution can be evaluated both for single large instances of locally treelike graphs, and in the thermodynamic limit of random graphs of finite mean degree in the configuration model class. The critical level h_{c} of the percolation transition is obtained through the condition that the largest eigenvalue of a weighted version B of a nonbacktracking matrix satisfies \u03bb_{max}(B)|_{h_{c}}=1. We present level-dependent distributions of local percolation probabilities for Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi networks and and for networks with degree distributions described by power laws. We find that there is a strong correlation between marginal single-node variances of a massless multivariate Gaussian and local percolation probabilities at a given level h, which is nearly perfect at negative values h, but weakens as h\u21970 for the system with power-law degree distribution, and generally also for negative values of h, if the multivariate Gaussian acquires a nonzero mass. The theoretical analysis simplifies in the case of random regular graphs with uniform edge weights of the weighted graph Laplacian of the system and uniform mass parameter of the Gaussian field. An asymptotic analysis reveals that for edge weights K=K(c)\u22611 the critical percolation threshold h_{c} decreases to 0, as the degree c of the random regular graph diverges.

Nevertheless, in practical networks, interactions often exist not just through the nodes themselves but also via the connections (edges) linking them, a configuration referred to as edge-coupled interdependent networks. Past research has shown that introducing a certain percentage of reinforced nodes or connecting edges can prevent catastrophic network collapses. However, the effect of reinforced inter-layer links in edge-coupled interdependent networks has yet to be addressed. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for studying percolation models in edge-coupled interdependent networks by introducing a proportion of reinforced inter-layer links and deriving detailed expressions for the giant and finite components and the percolation phase transition threshold. We find that there exists a required minimum proportion of the reinforced inter-layer links to prevent abrupt network collapse, which serves as a boundary to distinguish different phase transition types of a network. We provide both analytical and numerical solutions for random and scale-free networks, demonstrating that the proposed method exhibits superior reinforcement efficiency compared to intra-layer link reinforcement strategies. Theoretical analysis, simulation results, and real network systems validate our model and indicate that introducing a specific proportion of reinforced inter-layer links can prevent abrupt system failure and enhance network robustness in edge-coupled interdependent networks.",

Each component in the system can be represented by vertices, and the connections between components can be represented by edges. One of the most important problems in a complex network system is the ability of the system to maintain its functions when some components fail, which can be understood as the impact of the failure of complex network nodes on the overall connectivity of the network. In this paper, through the percolation theory, the network node random failure percolation threshold is obtained. For different public data sets, different attack methods and attack strategies are used to observe the change of the largest connected component in the network with the removal of nodes. Experiments show that target attacks are more harmful to the network than random attacks. At the same time, when the network faces target attacks, sequential targeted attacks are more destructive than simultaneous targeted attacks. For different attack strategies, in most cases, the attack strategies of degree and eigenvector are more destructive to the network, and reach the network\u2019s percolation threshold faster.",

The main task of the DSI problem is to optimize an estimator, such that the real source can be more precisely targeted. In this article, we assume that the state of a number of nodes, called observer set, in a network could be investigated if necessary, and study what configuration of those nodes could facilitate a better solution for the DSI problem. In particular, we find that the conventional error distance metric cannot precisely evaluate the effectiveness of varied DSI approaches in heterogeneous networks, and thus propose a novel and more general measurement, the candidate set, that is formulated to contain the diffusion source for sure. We propose the percolation-based evolutionary framework (PrEF) to optimize the observer set such that the candidate set can be minimized. Hence, one could further conduct more intensive investigation or search on only a few nodes to target the source. To achieve that, we first theoretically show that the size of the candidate set is bounded by the size of the largest component cover, and demonstrate that there are some similarities between the DSI problem and the network immunization problem. We find that, given the associated direction information of the diffusion is known on observers, the minimization of the candidate set is equivalent to the minimization of the order parameter if we view the observer set as the removal node set. Hence, PrEF is developed based on the network percolation and evolutionary algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on both synthetic and empirical networks in regard to varied circumstances. Our results show that the developed approach could achieve much smaller candidate sets compared to the state of the art in almost all cases, e.g., it is better in 26 out of 27 empirical networks and 155 out of 162 cases regarding the critical threshold. Meanwhile, our approach is also more stable, i.e., it works well irrespective of varied infection probabilities, diffusion models, and underlying networks. More importantly, we provide a framework for the analysis of the DSI problem in large-scale networks.",

To do so, we extend the cavity method to study networks where nodes have heterogeneous transmissibility. We find that vaccination with partial transmission still provides herd immunity and show how the herd immunity threshold depends upon the assortativity between nodes of different transmissibility. In addition, we study the impact of social distancing via bond percolation and show that percolation targeting links between nodes of high transmissibility can reduce the risk of an epidemic greater than targeting links between nodes of high degree. Finally, we extend recent methods to compute the distributional equations of risk in populations with heterogeneous transmissibility and show how targeted social distancing measures may reduce overall risk greater than untargeted vaccination campaigns, by comparing the effect of random and targeted strategies of node and link deletion on the risk distribution.",

We used COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) data to assess characteristics associated with pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations, including underlying medical conditions and vaccination status.

Medical records of a random sample of children stratified by age-group and site were abstracted; reported percentages were weighted to account for probability of selection. We assessed patient age, underlying medical conditions, and receipt of vaccine dose within 12 months before illness. Results Of 2016 children hospitalized for COVID-19, 1232 (61%) were aged < 2 years (611 aged < 6 months; 621 aged 6\u201323 months). Overall, 51% had no underlying condition, including 73% of infants aged < 6 months, 58% of children aged 6\u201323 months, and 24% of children aged 12\u201317 years (Figure). Among children aged < 2 years, prematurity was the most common underlying condition (17\u201320%). Neurologic disorders (27\u201331%) and asthma (21\u201333%) were most prevalent among children aged \u2265 2 years. Among 1379 children aged \u2265 6 months eligible for vaccination with vaccine data available, only 14% had received \u2265 1 vaccine dose within 12 months before illness, with the lowest frequency (9%) among children aged 6\u201323 months (Table). Among age-eligible children with neurologic disorders and asthma, only 18% and 16% were vaccinated, respectively. Conclusion Most children aged < 2 years hospitalized for COVID-19 during 2023 had no underlying conditions; underlying conditions were more prevalent among older children. More than 85% of age-eligible children had not received a vaccine dose within 12 months, including among children with underlying conditions. Increasing pediatric COVID-19 vaccination, especially among children with underlying medical conditions, could help reduce COVID-19 hospitalizations.

Their usefulness arises from the role of statistical network models in molecular epidemiology and in study design. Computational models, such as agent-based models that propagate disease on simulated contact networks, can be used to investigate the properties of different study designs and analysis plans. Particularly valuable is the use of these methods to assess how magnitude and detectability of intervention effects depend on both individual-level and network-level characteristics of the enrolled populations. Such investigation also provides an important approach to assessing consequences of study data being incomplete or measured with error. To address these goals, we consider two statistical network models: exponential random graph models and the more flexible congruence class models. We focus first on an historical use of these methods in design and monitoring of a cluster randomized trial in Botswana to evaluate the effect of combination HIV prevention modalities compared to standard of care on HIV incidence. We then present a framework for the design of a study of booster vaccine effects on infection with, and forward transmission of, SARS-CoV-2 variants. Motivation for the study is driven in part by guidance from the United Kingdom to base approval of booster vaccines with \u201cstrain changes\u201d that target variants on results of neutralizing antibody tests and information about safety, but without requiring evidence of clinical efficacy. Using designs informed by our agent-based network models, we show it may be feasible to conduct a trial of novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in a single large campus to obtain useful information regarding vaccine efficacy against susceptibility and infectiousness. If needed, the sample size could be increased by extending the study to a small number of campuses. Novel network methods may be useful in developing pragmatic SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trials that can leverage existing infrastructure to reduce costs and hasten the development of results.",

For each bond of the system, the tracer motion is governed by a convection-diffusion equation, with the drift term accounting for the local bond velocity. This represents an extension of random walks in disordered media to the important case of finite macroscopic flow rates.

This approach is implemented numerically for L\\ifmmode\\times\\else\\texttimes\\fi{}L random networks at the bond percolation threshold. When the total fluid flux Q vanishes, the kth moment of the transit time is found to scale with sample size as ${L}^{k(2+\\ensuremath{\\theta})}$, where \\ensuremath{\\theta}=t-\\ensuremath{\\beta}/\\ensuremath{\\nu} is the exponent describing the scale dependence of the diffusion coefficient of the ``ant in the labyrinth,'' ${D}_{\\mathrm{ant}}$.

This behavior of the moments at large Q is explained on the basis of a simple heuristic argument and from a more detailed analytical calculation. Furthermore, a scaling ansatz for the transit-time moments is postulated which describes our data for all flow rates.

Then the system is diluted by removing groups of k consecutive monomers according to a generalized random sequential adsorption mechanism. The study is conducted by following the behavior of two critical concentrations with size k: (1) jamming coverage \u03b8_{j,k}, which represents the concentration of occupied sites at which the jamming state is reached, and (2) inverse percolation threshold \u03b8_{c,k}, which corresponds to the maximum concentration of occupied sites for which connectivity disappears. The obtained results indicate that (1) the jamming coverage exhibits an increasing dependence on the size k-it rapidly increases for small values of k and asymptotically converges towards a definite value for infinitely large k sizes \u03b8_{j,k\u2192\u221e}\u22480.2701-and (2) the inverse percolation threshold is a decreasing function of k in the range 1\u2264k\u226417. For k\u226518, all jammed configurations are percolating states (the lattice remains connected even when the highest allowed concentration of removed sites is reached) and, consequently, there is no nonpercolating phase. This finding contrasts with the results obtained in literature for a complementary problem, where straight rigid k-mers are randomly and irreversibly deposited on a square lattice forming two layers. In this case, percolating and nonpercolating phases extend to infinity in the space of the parameter k and the model presents percolation transition for the whole range of k. The results obtained in the present study were also compared with those reported for the case of inverse percolation by removal of rigid linear k-mers from a square monolayer. The differences observed between monolayer and bilayer problems were discussed in terms of vulnerability and network robustness. Finally, the accurate determination of the critical exponents \u03bd, \u03b2, and \u03b3 reveals that the percolation phase transition involved in the system has the same universality class as the standard percolation problem.",

Using 1,945,071 real-time PCR results from nose and throat swabs taken from 383,812 participants between 1 December 2020 and 8 May 2021, we found that vaccination with the ChAdOx1 or BNT162b2 vaccines already reduced SARS-CoV-2 infections \u226521\u2009d after the first dose (61% (95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u200954\u201368%) versus 66% (95% CI\u2009=\u200960\u201371%), respectively), with greater reductions observed after a second dose (79% (95% CI\u2009=\u200965\u201388%) versus 80% (95% CI\u2009=\u200973\u201385%), respectively).

In contrast, in agglomerative percolation (AP) clusters grow by choosing randomly a target cluster and joining it with all its neighbors, as defined by the same set of virtual links. Previous studies showed that AP is in different universality classes from OP for several types of (virtual) networks (linear chains, trees, Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi networks), but most surprising were the results for two-dimensional (2D) lattices: While AP on the triangular lattice was found to be in the OP universality class, it behaved completely differently on the square lattice. In the present paper we explain this striking violation of universality by invoking bipartivity. While the square lattice is a bipartite graph, the triangular lattice is not. In conformity with this we show that AP on the honeycomb and simple cubic (3D) lattices--both of which are bipartite--are also not in the OP universality classes. More precisely, we claim that this violation of universality is basically due to a Z(2) symmetry that is spontaneously broken at the percolation threshold. We also discuss AP on bipartite random networks and suitable generalizations of AP on k-partite graphs.",

                    "abstract": "In this paper we report an extensive study using neutron scattering techniques of the spin fluctuations in the two-dimensional diluted near-Heisenberg antiferromagnet ${\\mathrm{Rb}}_{2}{\\mathrm{Mn}}_{c}{\\mathrm{Mg}}_{1\\ensuremath{-}c}{\\mathrm{F}}_{4}$. The concentrations studied are $c=0.54$, $c=0.57$, and $c=0.60$; the site-percolation concentration for the nearest-neighbor square lattice is ${c}_{p}=0.593$ so that these experiments span the percolation threshold. The point $c={c}_{p}$, $T=0$ represents the percolation multicritical point which terminates the line of second-order transition of the infinite network. We give a detailed description of the theory of the magnetic behavior around the percolation point; as the temperaturelike scaling field we suggest $\\ensuremath{\\mu}(T)={\\ensuremath{\\kappa}}_{1}(T)$ where ${\\ensuremath{\\kappa}}_{1}(T)$ is the inverse correlation length for the associated one-dimensional chain; for the static structure factor we propose the formula $\\mathcal{S}(|{c}_{p}\\ensuremath{-}c|,\\ensuremath{\\mu},\\stackrel{\\ensuremath{\\rightarrow}}{\\mathrm{Q}})\\ensuremath{\\propto}{\\ensuremath{\\kappa}}^{\\ensuremath{\\eta}}{({\\ensuremath{\\kappa}}^{2}+{Q}^{2})}^{\\ensuremath{-}1}$, where $\\ensuremath{\\kappa}=\\ensuremath{\\kappa}(|{c}_{p}\\ensuremath{-}c|,0)+\\ensuremath{\\kappa}(0,\\ensuremath{\\mu})$; that is, we assume that the geometrical and thermal inverse correlation lengths are simply additive. The $c=0.60$ sample is found to have a smeared second-order phase transition at about 8 K to a state with two-dimensional long-range order but only weak correlations in the third direction. The spin fluctuations in the precritical region are essentially identical to those in the concentrated systems, thus demonstrating that the phase transition in the $c=0.60$ infinite network is little affected by the proximity to the percolation threshold. For the $c=0.54$ and $c=0.57$ samples the correlation lengths and susceptibility increase with decreasing temperature down to about 3 K, below which temperature they saturate; for both samples the inverse correlation length is well described by the simple formula $\\ensuremath{\\kappa}=\\ensuremath{\\kappa}(\\ensuremath{\\Delta}C,0)+{[{\\ensuremath{\\kappa}}_{1}(T)]}^{0.9\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}0.05}$; the susceptibility follows the law $\\mathcal{S}(0)\\ensuremath{\\sim}{\\ensuremath{\\kappa}}^{1.5\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}0.15}$; both results are consistent with our scaling crossover formula and the assumption of the importance of the underlying one-dimensional links in the percolation clusters. The corresponding thermal critical exponents are ${\\ensuremath{\\nu}}_{T}=0.9\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}0.1$ and ${\\ensuremath{\\gamma}}_{T}=1.5\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}0.15$ compared with the percolation exponents ${\\ensuremath{\\nu}}_{p}=1.36$ and ${\\ensuremath{\\gamma}}_{p}=2.43$, so that the experimental crossover exponent is $\\ensuremath{\\varphi}=1.56\\ifmmode\\pm\\else\\textpm\\fi{}0.15$. There is currently no first-principle theory which properly accounts for this value of the crossover exponent, although the experiment includes within the errors the value $\\ensuremath{\\varphi}=1.7$, appropriate to a self-avoiding walk ansatz for the principal paths along which the correlations spread.",

We consider a population game framework where nodes choose whether or not to vaccinate themselves, and the epidemic risk is defined as the infection probability at the endemic state of the epidemic under a degree-based mean-field approximation. Motivated by studies in behavioral economics showing that humans perceive probabilities and risks in a nonlinear fashion, we specifically examine the impacts of such misperceptions on the Nash equilibrium protection strategies. We first establish the existence and uniqueness of a threshold equilibrium where nodes with degrees larger than a certain threshold vaccinate. When the vaccination cost is sufficiently high, we show that behavioral biases cause fewer players to vaccinate, and vice versa. We quantify this effect for a class of networks with power-law degree distributions by proving tight bounds on the ratio of equilibrium thresholds under behavioral and true perceptions of probabilities.

Further, we study structured populations with homophily and heterophily and the possibility of degree-targeted application distribution. Our results are based on a combination of explicit simulations and mean-field analysis. They indicate that there can be major differences in the epidemic size and epidemic probabilities which are equivalent in the normal susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) processes. Further, degree heterogeneity is seen to be especially important for the epidemic threshold but not as much for the epidemic size. The probability that tracing leads to quarantines is not as important as the application adoption rate. Finally, both strong homophily and especially heterophily with regard to application adoption can be detrimental.

However, in real-world scenarios, knowledge and observations of the network may be limited thereby precluding a full assessment of the optimal nodes to immunize (or remove) in order to avoid epidemic spreading such as that of current COVID-19 epidemic. Here, we study a novel immunization strategy where only n nodes are observed at a time and the most central between these n nodes is immunized (or attacked). This process is continued repeatedly until 1-p fraction of nodes are immunized (or attacked). We develop an analytical framework for this approach and determine the critical percolation threshold pc and the size of the giant component P\u221e for networks with arbitrary degree distributions P(k). In the limit of n\u2192\u221e we recover prior work on targeted attack, whereas for n=1 we recover the known case of random failure. Between these two extremes, we observe that as n increases, pc increases quickly towards its optimal value under targeted immunization (attack) with complete information. In particular, we find a new scaling relationship between |pc(\u221e) -pc (n)| and n as |pc(\u221e) -pc (n)|~n-1exp(-\u03b1 n). For Scale-free (SF) networks, where P(k)~k-\u03b3,2<\u03b3<3), we find that pc has a transition from zero to non-zero when n increases from n=1 to order of logN (N is the size of network). Thus, for SF networks, knowledge of order of logN nodes and immunizing them can reduce dramatically an epidemics.",

Mass media serve a pivotal function in facilitating the dissemination of epidemic-related information. Investigating coupled information\u2013epidemic dynamics, while accounting for the promotional effect of mass media in information dissemination, is of significant practical relevance. Nonetheless, in the extant research, scholars predominantly employ an assumption that mass media broadcast to all individuals equally within the network: this assumption overlooks the practical constraint imposed by the substantial social resources required to accomplish such comprehensive promotion. In response, this study introduces a coupled information\u2013epidemic spreading model with mass media that can selectively target and disseminate information to a specific proportion of high-degree nodes. We employed a microscopic Markov chain methodology to scrutinize our model, and we examined the influence of the various model parameters on the dynamic process. The findings of this study reveal that mass media broadcasts directed towards high-degree nodes within the information spreading layer can substantially reduce the infection density of the epidemic, and raise the spreading threshold of the epidemic. Additionally, as the mass media broadcast proportion increases, the suppression effect on the disease becomes stronger. Moreover, with a constant broadcast proportion, the suppression effect of mass media promotion on epidemic spreading within the model is more pronounced in a multiplex network with a negative interlayer degree correlation, compared to scenarios with positive or absent interlayer degree correlation.",

We systematically analyze these two issues\u2014relationships among differing results and levels of accuracy\u2014by studying the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model on uncorrelated configuration networks and a group of 56 real-world networks. In uncorrelated configuration networks the MFL and DMP methods yield identical predictions that are larger and more accurate than the prediction generated by the QMF method. As for the 56 real-world networks, the epidemic threshold obtained by the DMP method is more likely to reach the accurate epidemic threshold because it incorporates full network topology information and some dynamical correlations. We find that in most of the networks with positive degree-degree correlations, an eigenvector localized on the high k-core nodes, or a high level of clustering, the epidemic threshold predicted by the MFL method, which uses the degree distribution as the only input information, performs better than the other two methods.",

We show how the increase of the app adoption level raises the value of the epidemic threshold, which is eventually maximized when high-degree nodes are preferentially targeted.

Motivated by studies in behavioral economics showing that humans perceive probabilities and risks in a nonlinear fashion, we specifically examine the impacts of such misperceptions on the Nash equilibrium protection strategies. We first establish the existence and uniqueness of a threshold equilibrium where nodes with degrees larger than a certain threshold vaccinate. When the vaccination cost is sufficiently high, we show that behavioral biases cause fewer players to vaccinate, and vice versa. We quantify this effect for a class of networks with power-law degree distributions by proving tight bounds on the ratio of equilibrium thresholds under behavioral and true perceptions of probabilities.

                    "abstract": "The contact structure of a population plays an important role in transmission of infection. Many ``structured models'' capture aspects of the contact structure through an underlying network or a mixing matrix. An important observation in such models, is that once a fraction $1-1/\\mathcal{R}_0$ has been infected, the residual susceptible population can no longer sustain an epidemic. A recent observation of some structured models is that this threshold can be crossed with a smaller fraction of infected individuals, because the disease acts like a targeted vaccine, preferentially immunizing higher-risk individuals who play a greater role in transmission. Therefore, a limited ``first wave'' may leave behind a residual population that cannot support a second wave once interventions are lifted. In this paper, we systematically analyse a number of mean-field models for networks and other structured populations to address issues relevant to the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular, we consider herd-immunity under several scenarios. We confirm that, in networks with high degree heterogeneity, the first wave confers herd-immunity with significantly fewer infections than equivalent models with lower degree heterogeneity. However, if modelling the intervention as a change in the contact network, then this effect might become more subtle. Indeed, modifying the structure can shield highly connected nodes from becoming infected during the first wave and make the second wave more substantial. We confirm this finding by using an age-structured compartmental model parameterised with real data and comparing lockdown periods implemented either as a global scaling of the mixing matrix or age-specific structural changes. We find that results regarding herd immunity levels are strongly dependent on the model, the duration of lockdown and how lockdown is implemented.",

                    "abstract": "Background:\n CD22 is an attractive target for Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) since it is expressed by most B-cell malignancies. However, CAR targeting of CD22 is challenging since CD22 has a long ectodomain of 300 \u00c5, which is several times wider than the optimal immune synapse. Further, the ectodomain is rigid, so even targeting of membrane proximal domains may not allow effective synapse formation. Further still, CD22 is expressed at low density and dropping of antigen density has been described as a mode of escape. A previously described CD22 CAR based on the M971 antibody required a very short linker between single-chain VH-VL for sensitive function, presumably to allow CAR concatenation but which comes at the cost of basal signalling. Our aim was to engineer an anti-CD22 CAR which triggered not only killing, but proliferation in response to less than 1000 CD22 molecules per cell, without basal signalling. We conducted a functional screen for stable / high affinity binders recognizing the CD22 membrane proximal domains that function in a CAR against cells expressing low levels of CD22 target.\n Methods:\n Binders were generated in two campaigns. Hyperimmune mice were vaccinated with recombinant CD22 protein lacking the highly immunogenic N-terminal V-type domain. Similarly, Wistar rats were immunized via genetic vaccination using a modified gene encoding the 4 membrane proximal domains of CD22, cloned into a DNA vaccine plasmid designed to stimulate a humoral immune response. A total of 18 binders passed biophysical screening properties of stability, affinity and proximal binding. Binding affinity ranged between 1-36.5nM; the binders were cloned into 41BB-Zeta signalling CARs. We generated a panel of CD22 expressing SupT1 cell lines. Using expression cassettes with amber stop codons preceding the CD22 frame, we generated stable SuptT1 cell lines which express CD22 below the limit of amplified flow cytometry detection (<100 copies, CD22Und) and a cell line with 255 copies / cell (CD22Low). In addition, using conventional means, we generated cell lines expressing intermediate and high levels of CD22 expression (CD22Mid=3,444, CD22High=78,916 copies/cell).\n Results:\n The 18 CAR constructs went through an initial round of screening using primary T-cells as effectors and engineered SupT1 cells as targets. A threshold of >50% killing of CD22Und target cells at an effector:target (E:T) ratio of 1:4 at 72 hour was set for further characterization. Only one CAR derived from the hyperimmune murine binders, and two derived from the rat binders met this threshold. Further characterization of killing at lower E:T ratios, cytokine release and proliferation revealed that CAR based on the rat binder 9A8 had superior function in response to low density target cells compared with the other two CARs and was characterized further and compared with the M971 CAR. This comparison showed approximately 2-fold better killing of CD22Und 9A8, and approximately 4-fold increased proliferation with no basal signalling. Next, we tried to correlate binder characteristics with sensitivity to low CD22 density. No correlation was found between either affinity, epitope, or stability and sensitivity. In fact, two of the best candidates could be paired with CARs which recognized the same CD22 domain and had similar binding kinetics and stability but had much lower sensitivity to CD22. This suggests that some other as yet unappreciated binder characteristic leads to sensitivity and we are currently investigating this via a structural analysis of binder / target interaction. Finally, we are currently testing 9A8 co-expressed with the CAT19 CD19 CAR (AUTO1) (Blood 2017 130:806) in small animal models of B-ALL.\n Conclusion:\n A highly sensitive CD22 CAR could be selected by empiric screening of CARs derived from a set of binders which target the proximal domains of CD22. CAR concatenation was not required for a high-degree of sensitivity to CD22 antigen. No correlation was found between binder characteristics and function.\n \n \n Thomas: Autolus: Employment, Equity Ownership. Cordoba:Autolus: Employment, Equity Ownership.

To better capture real-world dynamics, it is essential to develop epidemic models that incorporate diverse, realistic factors. In this study, we propose a coupled disease-information spreading model on multiplex networks that simultaneously accounts for three critical dimensions: media influence, higher-order interactions, and population mobility. This integrated framework enables a systematic analysis of synergistic spreading mechanisms under practical constraints and facilitates the exploration of effective epidemic containment strategies. We employ a microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA) to derive the coupled dynamical equations and identify epidemic thresholds, which are then validated through extensive Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Our results show that both mass media dissemination and higher-order network structures contribute to suppressing disease transmission by enhancing public awareness. However, the containment effect of higher-order interactions weakens as the order of simplices increases. We also explore the influence of subpopulation characteristics, revealing that increasing inter-subpopulation connectivity in a connected metapopulation network leads to lower disease prevalence. Furthermore, guiding individuals to migrate toward less accessible or more isolated subpopulations is shown to effectively mitigate epidemic spread. These findings offer valuable insights for designing targeted and adaptive intervention strategies in complex epidemic settings.",

Existing studies of ranking node importance in multilayer networks are mostly based on the network structure, while neglecting how the structural and dynamical couplings of multiple layers impact the spreading influence of nodes in coevolving dynamics. Here we investigate on the identification of influential spreaders in the information-disease coupled spreading dynamics on multiplex networks. Firstly we explicitly reveal that three interlayer coupling factors, which are the two-layer relative spreading rate, the interlayer coupling strength and the interlayer degree correlation, significantly impact the spreading influence of a node in the contact layer where disease spreads. The suppression effect from the information layer makes the structural centrality of nodes in the contact layer fail to predict their influence. Then by mapping the coevolving spreading processes into percolation and using the message-passing approach, we propose a method to calculate the outbreak size of disease starting from a single seed node, which is used to estimate the spreading influence of the node and identify the most influential spreaders in coevolving dynamics on multiplex networks.

In this article we study how the spreading of knowledge of a disease affects the propagation of that disease in a population of interacting individuals. For that, we analyze the interaction between two different processes on multiplex networks: the propagation of an epidemic using the susceptible-infected-susceptible dynamics and the dissemination of information about the disease-and its prevention methods-using the unaware-aware-unaware dynamics, so that informed individuals are less likely to be infected. Unlike previous related models where disease and information spread at the same time scale, we introduce here a parameter that controls the relative speed between the propagation of the two processes. We study the behavior of this model using a mean-field approach that gives results in good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations on homogeneous complex networks. We find that increasing the rate of information dissemination reduces the disease prevalence, as one may expect. However, increasing the speed of the information process as compared to that of the epidemic process has the counterintuitive effect of increasing the disease prevalence.
