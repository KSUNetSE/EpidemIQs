                    "abstract": "Complex dynamical behaviors, such as bistable and periodic phenomena, have been shown to emerge due to group interactions in higher-order networks. Traditionally, the transitions between these behaviors are primarily driven by changing model parameters that represent the transmission characteristics of a single infectious disease, while maintaining a fixed network structure. However, for newly emerging infectious diseases, modifying network structures is crucial as transmission characteristics are generally fixed. This study investigates transitions between these dynamical behaviors by altering the network structure, specifically facet degree heterogeneity in the simplicial complex, under same model parameters. We develop a dynamical model incorporating facet degree distributions and derive the corresponding outbreak thresholds. Firstly, we validated the rationality of the model using Monte Carlo simulation. Subsequently, by comparing the general model and the base model under the same and different network structures, we demonstrate the advantage of the general model in capturing dynamical behavior. Furthermore, it was discovered that variations in the facet degree heterogeneity lead to phase transitions of the stability region of equilibrium. We finally provide the distribution of the stable equilibrium regions with varying facet degree heterogeneity. These findings offer valuable insights for the prevention and control of infectious diseases.",

This paper first proved that a backward bifurcation occurs under certain conditions, which means that R0<1 is not enough to eradicate this disease from the population. However, if the direction is positive, we find that within a certain parameter range, there may be multiple equilibrium points near R0=1. Secondly, the influence of population heterogeneity on virus transmission is analyzed, and the optimal control theory is used to further study the time-varying control of the disease. Finally, numerical simulations verify the stability of the system and the effectiveness of the optimal control strategy.",

Going beyond pairwise interactions, Stasi et al.

In this paper we initiate the rigorous study of the hypergraph <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\boldsymbol {\\beta } $ </tex-math></inline-formula>-model with multiple layers, which allows for hyperedges of different sizes across the layers. To begin with, we derive the rates of convergence of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates and establish their minimax rate optimality. We also derive the limiting distribution of the ML estimates and construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the model parameters. Next, we consider the goodness-of-fit problem in the hypergraph <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\boldsymbol {\\beta } $ </tex-math></inline-formula>-model. Specifically, we establish the asymptotic normality of the likelihood ratio (LR) test under the null hypothesis, derive its detection threshold, and also its limiting power at the threshold. Interestingly, the detection threshold of the LR test turns out to be minimax optimal, that is, all tests are asymptotically powerless below this threshold. The theoretical results are further validated in numerical experiments. In addition to developing the theoretical framework for estimation and inference for hypergraph <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\boldsymbol {\\beta } $ </tex-math></inline-formula>-models, the above results fill a number of gaps in the graph <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\boldsymbol {\\beta } $ </tex-math></inline-formula>-model literature, such as the minimax optimality of the ML estimates and the non-null properties of the LR test, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been studied before.",

A Bayesian method is proposed to select nodal features in both dense and sparse networks under a mild assumption on popularity parameters. The proposed approach is implemented via Gibbs sampling. To alleviate the computational burden for large sparse networks, we further develop a working model in which parameters are updated based on a dense sub-graph at each step. Model selection consistency is established for both models, in the sense that the probability of the true model being selected converges to one asymptotically, even when the dimension grows with the network size at an exponential rate. The performance of the proposed models and estimation procedures are illustrated through Monte Carlo studies and three real world examples.

                    "abstract": "I formulate and study a model of undirected dyadic link formation which allows for assortative matching on observed agent characteristics (homophily) as well as unrestricted agent level heterogeneity in link surplus (degree heterogeneity). Similar to fixed effects panel data analyses, the joint distribution of observed and unobserved agent-level characteristics is left unrestricted. To motivate the introduction of degree heterogeneity, as well as its fixed effect treatment, I show how its presence can bias conventional homophily measures. Two estimators for the (common) homophily parameter, beta0, are developed and their properties studied under an asymptotic sequence involving a single network growing large. The first,tetrad logit (TL), estimator conditions on a sufficient statistic for the degree heterogeneity. The TL estimator is a fourth-order U-Process minimizer. Although the fourth-order summation in the TL criterion function is over the i = 1...N agents in the network, due to a degeneracy property, the leading variance term of hat-beta_TL is of order 1/n, where n = N*(N-1)/2 equals the number of observed dyads. Using martingale theory, I show that the limiting distribution of hat-beta_TL (appropriately scaled and normalized) is normal. The second, joint maximum likelihood (JML), estimator treats the degree heterogeneity as additional (incidental) parameters to be estimated. The properties of hat-beta_JML are also non-standard due to a parameter space which grows with the size of the network. Adapting and extending recent results from random graph theory and non-linear panel data analysis (e.g., Chatterjee, Diaconis and Sly, 2011; Hahn and Newey, 2004), I show that the limit distribution of hat-beta_JML is also normal, but contains a bias term. Accurate inference necessitates bias-correction. The TL estimate is consistent under sparse graph sequences, where the number of links per agent is small relative to the total number of agents, as well as dense graphs sequences, where the number of links per agent is proportional to the total number of agents in the limit. Consistency of the JML estimate, in contrast, is shown only under dense graph sequences. The finite sample properties of hat-beta_TL and hat-beta_JML are explored in a series of Monte Carlo experiments.",

The rapid spread throughout the world was accompanied by an alarming number of infected patients and increasing number of deaths gradually. If the number of infected cases can be predicted in advance, it would have a large contribution to controlling this pandemic in any area. Therefore, this study introduces an integrated model for predicting the number of confirmed cases from the perspective of Bangladesh. Moreover, the number of quarantined patients and the change in basic reproduction rate (the R0-value) can also be evaluated using this model. This integrated model combines the SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Removed) epidemiological model and neural networks. The model was trained using available data from 250 days. The accuracy of the prediction of confirmed cases is almost between 90% and 99%. The performance of this integrated model was evaluated by showing the difference in accuracy between the integrated model and the general SEIR model. The result shows that the integrated model is more accurate than the general SEIR model while predicting the number of confirmed cases in Bangladesh.",

Despite their wide availability, there is a shortage of statistical models amenable for inference, specially when contextual information and degree heterogeneity are present. This paper presents an annotated graph model with parameters explicitly accounting for these features. To overcome the curse of dimensionality due to modelling degree heterogeneity, we introduce a sparsity assumption and propose a penalized likelihood approach with $\\ell_1$-regularization for parameter estimation. We study the estimation and selection consistency of this approach under a sparse network assumption, and show that inference on the covariate parameter is straightforward, thus bypassing the need for the kind of debiasing commonly employed in $\\ell_1$-penalized likelihood estimation. Simulation and data analysis corroborate our theoretical findings.",
