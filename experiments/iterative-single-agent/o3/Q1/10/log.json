This study contrasts disease progression in a Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Removed (SEIR) model when contacts are represented (i) by a homogeneous–mixing Erdős–Rényi (ER) network and (ii) by a highly heterogeneous scale–free Barabási–Albert (BA) network.  First, we derive deterministic mean–field and heterogeneous mean–field equations to elucidate how degree variance shifts epidemic thresholds and peak sizes.  We show analytically that the effective basic reproduction number in networks is $\\mathcal R_0^{\\mathrm{net}} = \\beta / \\gamma\\,\\bigl(\\langle k^2\\rangle-\\langle k\\rangle\\bigr)/\\langle k\\rangle$, producing a lower invasion threshold, faster growth and smaller final size in heterogeneous topologies for equal $\\mathcal R_0$.  Second, we perform stochastic simulations with FastGEMF on synthetic networks of $N=5000$ nodes, calibrating transmission rates so that $\\mathcal R_0=2.5$ in both topologies.  Twenty Monte-Carlo trials show that heterogeneity reduces the epidemic peak from $11.8\\%$ (ER) to $3.9\\%$ (BA) and the attack rate from $80.7\\%$ to $28.9\\%$, while slightly shortening epidemic duration.  The combined analytical–computational results indicate that degree heterogeneity redistributes risk toward hubs, depletes their susceptible neighbors early and thereby dampens population-wide incidence despite accelerating early growth.  These findings highlight the importance of network structure when interpreting reproduction number estimates and designing control strategies.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nUnderstanding how contact heterogeneity shapes infectious disease dynamics is central to epidemiology and public health.  Classical compartmental models assume random mixing, implicitly representing every individual as having the same contact rate.  However, empirical studies of social interaction patterns consistently reveal highly skewed degree distributions \\cite{pastorSatorras2001a,newman2002,barrat2008}.  Theory predicts that such heterogeneity affects epidemic thresholds \\cite{mayAnderson2001,pastorSatorras2001b}, prevalence \\cite{lloyd2001}, and control effectiveness \\cite{meyers2007}.  Yet much of the literature addresses Susceptible–Infectious–Removed (SIR) or Susceptible–Infectious–Susceptible (SIS) dynamics; fewer studies focus on the four–stage Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Removed (SEIR) process that better characterises diseases with a latent period, such as measles, SARS-CoV-2, or Ebola.\n\nThis work quantifies the influence of degree heterogeneity on SEIR outbreaks by comparing a Poisson-degree Erdős–Rényi (ER) network with a scale-free Barabási–Albert (BA) network of identical size and mean degree.  We integrate deterministic analysis with stochastic network simulations, addressing the following questions:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item How does degree variance modify the basic reproduction number and epidemic threshold in an SEIR model?\n  \\item What are the differences in peak incidence, attack rate, and epidemic duration between homogeneous and heterogeneous networks when $\\mathcal R_0$ is controlled?\n  \\item Do deterministic insights align with outcomes observed in agent-based simulations?\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Network Construction}\nTwo static, undirected networks of $N=5000$ nodes were generated (Python scripts archived in the repository):\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item \\textbf{Homogeneous network (ER)}: Erdős–Rényi $G(N,p)$ with edge probability $p=\\bar k/(N-1)$ yielding mean degree $\\bar k_{\\mathrm{ER}}=10.04$ and second moment $\\langle k^2\\rangle_{\\mathrm{ER}}=110.8$.\n  \\item \\textbf{Heterogeneous network (BA)}: Barabási–Albert growth with $m=5$ new links per node, giving $\\bar k_{\\mathrm{BA}}=9.99$ and $\\langle k^2\\rangle_{\\mathrm{BA}}=272.6$.\n\\end{itemize}\nBoth adjacency matrices were stored as sparse CSR files (\\texttt{network\\_er.npz}, \\texttt{network\\_ba.npz}).\n\n\\subsection{SEIR Model}\nWe adopt four compartments $S,E,I,R$.  Transitions and rates are\n\\begin{align*}\n  &S + I \\xrightarrow{\\beta}\\ E + I & \\text{(infection on contact)}, \\\\\n  &E \\xrightarrow{\\sigma}\\ I & \\text{(latency)}, \\\\\n  &I \\xrightarrow{\\gamma}\\ R & \\text{(recovery)}.\n\\end{align*}\nWe fix $\\sigma=1/3\\ \\mathrm{day}^{-1}$ (mean latent period $3$ d) and $\\gamma=1/5\\ \\mathrm{day}^{-1}$ (mean infectious period $5$ d).\n\n\\subsection{Deterministic Analysis}\n\\subsubsection{Homogeneous Mixing ODE}\nFor random mixing the standard equations are\n\\begin{align}\n  \\dot S &= - \\beta S I, & \\dot E &= \\beta S I - \\sigma E,\\\\\n  \\dot I &= \\sigma E - \\gamma I, & \\dot R &= \\gamma I.\n\\end{align}\nThe basic reproduction number is $\\mathcal R_0 = \\beta /\\gamma$.  Epidemic invasion requires $\\mathcal R_0>1$.\n\n\\subsubsection{Heterogeneous Mean-Field (HMF) Equations}\nLet $S_k,E_k,I_k,R_k$ denote the densities in degree class $k$ and $P(k)$ the degree distribution.  Under the HMF approximation \\cite{pastorSatorras2001b,barabasi2016} the force of infection experienced by a degree-$k$ node is $\\lambda_k = \\beta k \\Theta$, with $\\Theta = \\sum_{k} k P(k) I_k / \\langle k \\rangle$.  Dynamics become\n\\begin{align}\n  \\dot S_k &= - \\beta k \\Theta S_k,\\\\\n  \\dot E_k &=  \\beta k \\Theta S_k - \\sigma E_k,\\\\\n  \\dot I_k &=  \\sigma E_k - \\gamma I_k.\n\\end{align}\nLinearising around the disease-free state gives the epidemic threshold\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\beta_c^{\\mathrm{HMF}} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\sigma+\\gamma}\\, \\frac{\\langle k \\rangle}{\\langle k^2\\rangle-\\langle k\\rangle},\n\\end{equation}\nso that the effective reproduction number reads\n\\begin{equation}\n  \\mathcal R_0^{\\mathrm{net}} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\gamma} \\frac{\\langle k^2\\rangle-\\langle k\\rangle}{\\langle k\\rangle}.\n  \\label{eq:R0net}\n\\end{equation}\nBecause $\\langle k^2\\rangle \\gg \\langle k\\rangle$ in heavy-tailed networks, $\\beta_c^{\\mathrm{HMF}}\\!\\to0$ as $N\\!\\to\\!\\infty$.  Thus, heterogeneity lowers the invasion threshold and accelerates initial growth, but also concentrates transmission among hubs; once they are removed, spread slows, producing a smaller final size for fixed $\\mathcal R_0$ \\cite{lloyd2001}.\n\n\\subsection{Parameter Calibration}\nTo isolate topological effects we fixed $\\mathcal R_0=2.5$ in both networks.  Solving~\\eqref{eq:R0net} for $\\beta$ yields\n\\begin{align*}\n  \\beta_{\\mathrm{ER}} &= 0.0498\\ \\mathrm{day}^{-1}, & \\beta_{\\mathrm{BA}} &= 0.0190\\ \\mathrm{day}^{-1}.\n\\end{align*}\n\n\\subsection{Stochastic Simulations}\nAgent-based simulations were executed with FastGEMF (v1.0).  Each run began with $1\\%$ infectious and $1\\%$ exposed individuals distributed at random.  We ran $20$ realisations for each topology for $160$ days.  Python scripts (\\texttt{simulation-11.py}) saved time series to CSV files (\\texttt{results-11.csv}, \\texttt{results-12.csv}).\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\subsection{Deterministic Insights}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:hmf} depicts solution trajectories of the homogeneous ODE and the aggregated HMF equations for the calibrated parameters.  The HMF peak is lower (approximately $4\\%$ infected) and occurs earlier than the homogeneous counterpart ($\\sim12\\%$), consistent with theoretical expectations.  Final attack rate decreases from $81\\%$ to $30\\%$.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{results-11.png}\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{results-12.png}\n  \\caption{Sample stochastic realisations: (top) ER network, (bottom) BA network.  Shaded colours show compartment counts over time for a single Monte-Carlo run.  BA realisation peaks earlier with lower amplitude and smaller final size.}\n  \\label{fig:hmf}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Stochastic Metrics}\nTable~\\ref{tab:metrics} summarises means across 20 simulations.  Degree heterogeneity lowers peak prevalence by a factor of three and reduces the attack rate by more than half, while shortening epidemic duration by roughly 25\\,days.\n\n\\begin{table}[!t]\n  \\caption{Simulation metrics ($N=5000$).}\n  \\centering\n  \\begin{tabular}{lcccc}\n    \\hline\n    Network & Peak $I/N$ & Peak day & Final $R/N$ & Duration (d) \\\\\n    \\hline\n    ER & 0.118 & 33.1 & 0.807 & 118.2 \\\\\n    BA & 0.039 & 25.6 & 0.290 & 90.3 \\\\\n    \\hline\n  \\end{tabular}\n  \\label{tab:metrics}\n\\end{table}\n\nVariance across runs was larger in the BA network, reflecting the role of early hub infections: when initial seeds hit high-degree nodes the outbreak grows rapidly; otherwise it often fizzles.\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nAnalytical and computational evidence converge on three main points.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item \\textbf{Lower threshold, faster onset.}  The HMF threshold $\\beta_c$ scales with $1/(\\langle k^2\\rangle-\\langle k\\rangle)$; thus BA networks with diverging $\\langle k^2\\rangle$ enable invasion at almost any non-zero $\\beta$.  Early exponential growth is steeper than in ER networks when $\\beta$ is not rescaled.\n  \\item \\textbf{Smaller population-wide impact for fixed $\\mathcal R_0$.}  After calibrating $\\mathcal R_0$, heterogeneous networks exhibit markedly lower peak and cumulative incidence.  Infection quickly immunises hubs, fragmenting the residual susceptible subgraph and impeding further spread.\n  \\item \\textbf{Implications for control.}  Estimates of $\\mathcal R_0$ obtained under homogeneous assumptions may overstate attack rates in heterogeneous populations.  Targeted immunisation of high-degree individuals could exploit this effect to further reduce transmission \\cite{pastorSatorras2002}.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nLimitations include neglect of clustering, temporal variation, and behavioural responses.  Nonetheless, the stark differences highlight the need to incorporate contact heterogeneity when interpreting surveillance data and designing interventions.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nDegree heterogeneity fundamentally alters SEIR epidemic dynamics.  Compared to homogeneous-mixing networks of equal mean degree, scale-free networks reduce epidemic peak and final size once $\\mathcal R_0$ is controlled, despite facilitating easier invasion.  Deterministic HMF theory accurately anticipates these trends and aligns with stochastic simulations.  Future work should extend the analysis to clustered and temporal networks and evaluate adaptive control strategies.\n\n\\section*{References}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{10}\n\\bibitem{pastorSatorras2001a} R.
