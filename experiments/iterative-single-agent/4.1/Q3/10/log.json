This study investigates how the temporal structuring of contacts in a population of 1000 nodes---where each node activates with probability $\\alpha=0.1$ and makes $m=2$ contacts per event---modifies the outcome of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic process (with $R_0=3$) compared to simulation on the corresponding weighted static network derived by aggregation. Through mechanistic simulation, we demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative discrepancies in epidemic outcomes. Notably, temporal constraints significantly suppress the epidemic peak, reduce final epidemic size, and extend outbreak duration, relative to the static case. These findings illustrate key pitfalls in static network projections and underscore the necessity of temporal models for accurate outbreak estimation and intervention planning.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nModeling infectious disease spread over social and contact networks has become crucial for preparing and implementing public health interventions. While classic network models presume static (time-invariant) links between individuals, actual contact networks are inherently dynamic---with links appearing and disappearing as people interact over time. This temporal structure fundamentally constrains the set of transmission pathways available to a pathogen, and thereby the epidemic outcomes \\cite{liu2012contagion,kim2019impact,stehle2011high}.\n\nThe SIR model remains a cornerstone for epidemic modeling due to its mechanistic transparency and interpretability. However, the use of time-aggregated static networks has been shown to systematically overestimate epidemic size, peak, and speed, relative to models that account for fine-grained temporal contact structure \\cite{holme2012temporal,li2021concurrency,masuda2013predicting}. This discrepancy arises because static aggregation collapses all observed contacts into ever-present links, discarding the order and concurrency of real interactions. As a result, static networks artifactually increase path redundancy and concurrency, opening up transmission pathways that never coexist in reality. Recent work demonstrates that this can lead to gross inflation of the predicted epidemic risk and outbreak magnitude \\cite{fujimoto2024static}.\n\nThis study aims to quantitatively test these theoretical insights using a controlled simulation experiment. We address the following question: for an SIR epidemic process with $R_0=3$ on an activity-driven temporal network ($N=1000$, $\\alpha=0.1$, $m=2$) and its weighted static time-aggregated counterpart, how does temporal ordering affect peak prevalence, final size, and outbreak duration? This comparison highlights both the strengths and pitfalls of common network abstractions and quantifies the control conferred by temporal effects on epidemic spread.\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Network Construction}\nWe consider a population of $N=1000$ nodes. In the activity-driven temporal network, at each discrete time step, each node becomes active with probability $\\alpha=0.1$ and, if active, establishes $m=2$ edges to other uniformly random nodes (excluding itself). These connections are transient---lasting for that single time step. For reference and simulation, the activation and edge-formation event sequence is simulated for $T=1000$ steps. This structure closely mimics empirical bursty social contact processes \\cite{kim2019impact}.\n\nTo construct the corresponding time-aggregated static network, all pairs of nodes that ever shared a link within the temporal window are joined by an edge whose weight equals the normalized total frequency of their contacts. This static representation is then used directly in the SIR simulation as an unweighted network for comparability. The mean degree $\\langle k \\rangle \\approx 329$ and the second moment $\\langle k^2 \\rangle \\approx 1.09 \\times 10^5$ were computed for parameterization. The degree distribution is shown in Figure~\\ref{fig1:static-degree}. \\begin{figure}[!h]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.6\\linewidth]{static_degree_dist.png}\n  \\caption{Degree distribution of the aggregated static network.}\n  \\label{fig1:static-degree}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Epidemic Model}\nWe implement an SIR compartmental model with parameters calibrated for an initial basic reproduction number $R_0=3$. The recovery rate is set to $\\gamma=0.2$ (mean infectious period 5 steps), and the infection rate for the network model is calculated as $\\beta=R_0\\gamma/q$, with $q=(\\langle k^2 \\rangle - \\langle k \\rangle)/\\langle k \\rangle$. This yields $\\beta\\approx 0.00182$ for both network topologies for baseline comparability.\n\nInitial conditions for each simulation are 5 randomly infected individuals with the remainder susceptible. Ten stochastic runs were performed for robustness on the static network; the temporal simulation was run due to computational limits for a single long time series, as burstiness and low concurrency strongly limit transmission.\n\nAll simulation code is available as supplementary material.\n\\section{Results}\n\\subsection{Epidemic Dynamics Comparison}\nFigure~\\ref{fig:results} compares the SIR compartment populations for static versus temporal simulations. \n\n\\begin{figure}[!htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.85\\linewidth]{results-comparison.png}\n\\caption{Population time-series of Susceptible (S), Infected (I), and Recovered (R) for static aggregated network (solid lines) and activity-driven temporal network (dashed lines).}\n\\label{fig:results}\n\\end{figure}\n\nA striking qualitative divergence is evident. The static network exhibits a rapid epidemic: the infected population peaks sharply ($I_{\\max}=272$), with the outbreak over in $<60$ steps and $>90\\%$ of the population ultimately infected and recovered ($R_{\\infty}=918$). By contrast, the temporal epidemic produces at most a handful of simultaneous infections ($I_{\\max}=6$), with almost no secondary outbreaks, and $R_{\\infty}=6$; the susceptible pool remains essentially intact.\n\nSummary statistics (Table~\\ref{tab:metrics}) show that the static network overestimates final epidemic size, peak size, and shortens duration compared to the temporal network.\n\n\\begin{table}[h]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Comparison of SIR epidemic metrics on static aggregated and temporal activity-driven networks.}\n\\label{tab:metrics}\n\\begin{tabular}{lcccc}\n\\hline\nNetwork      & Peak Infected & Time to Peak & Final Size (Recovered) & Duration \\\\\n\\hline\nStatic Aggregated & 272        & $t=13.2$     & 918                   & 56.4 \\\\\nTemporal         & 6          & $t=134$      & 6                     & 1000+ \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\subsection{Interpretation}\nThe temporal network structure constrains possible infection chains to those supported by real time-ordered contact events. As a result, simultaneous paths and concurrency are rare, bursty, and non-redundant, which dramatically limits the effective reach of an epidemic \\cite{li2021concurrency,stehle2011high,sato2021contact}. In contrast, static aggregation artifacts create transmission paths that never exist concurrently, artificially facilitating large-scale outbreaks.\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nThese findings quantitatively demonstrate, in a mechanistic experiment, that time-aggregated static network models can severely overestimate epidemic risk, outbreak size, and speed compared to models that correctly respect temporal contact dynamics. The key factors are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\textbf{Concurrency and Redundant Pathways:} Static networks treat all observed ties as simultaneously available, increasing concurrency and path redundancy. In reality, most contacts are transient and occur in sequences that restrict transmission paths strictly more than the static analogue allows.\n\\item \\textbf{Bursty and Sparse Activation:} In activity-driven or empirical temporal networks with low average edge density per time step, the chance for infections to propagate is dramatically reduced, especially for diseases with moderate $R_0$ or short infectious periods.\n\\item \\textbf{Event Ordering:} Chain reactions needed for large outbreaks often cannot form as required edges never overlap in time. Static models, by collapsing time-order, introduce spurious chains.\n\\end{itemize}\nThese results reinforce a consensus emerging in the recent literature: temporal dynamics and concurrency levels must be preserved for robust epidemic forecasting and intervention design \\cite{li2021concurrency, stehle2011high, holme2012temporal, masuda2013predicting, fujimoto2024static}.\n\n\\subsection{Limitations}\nWhile our simulations operate on a stylized activity-driven model, real-world networks also have group structure, heterogeneous activities, and adaptive or memory-based contact patterns. These can further modulate epidemic potential and the limits of static approximations \\cite{kim2019impact}. Like all computational studies, our outcomes depend on parameter selection---but the qualitative suppression of epidemic reach by temporal structure is robust to the activity and memory regime \\cite{liu2012contagion,kim2019impact}.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nEpidemic simulations on activity-driven temporal networks with $R_0=3$ reveal a dramatic suppression of outbreak potential relative to simulations on time-aggregated static networks, which grossly overestimate epidemic spread. Temporal constraints---in particular, the burstiness and order of contacts---inhibit the formation of simultaneous transmission pathways necessary for large outbreaks. These results underscore the essential need to use models that preserve temporal information whenever possible for accurate epidemic risk estimation.\n\n\\section{References}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{}\n\n\\bibitem{liu2012contagion} Suyu Liu, Andrea Baronchelli, N.
