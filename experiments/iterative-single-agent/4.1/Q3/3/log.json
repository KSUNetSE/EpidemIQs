We investigate the effect of temporal structure in activity-driven networks, where nodes activate stochastically and form transient edges, on the propagation of an SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) epidemic with $R_0=3$. We compare outcomes with those on the time-aggregated network, where edge weights represent the frequency of contacts. Simulations reveal that the temporal network suppresses epidemic outbreak, maintaining low infection prevalence, in stark contrast to its static aggregated counterpart where rapid, large-scale outbreaks are observed. Our results illustrate that aggregation overestimates epidemic risk by neglecting temporal constraints that limit real-world transmission paths.\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nEpidemic processes unfold over dynamic networks of contacts between individuals. Traditional models often simplify these complexities by using static, time-aggregated representations, thus ignoring the temporal sequence and duration of contacts. In particular, the activity-driven network model\\cite{Perra2012} captures salient features of temporal social interactions, where each node has a chance to activate and form links at each time-step. Prior studies have demonstrated that aggregation of such networks produces highly connected static graphs with broad degree distributions, which can significantly influence epidemic thresholds and outbreak potential\\cite{Moinet2018,Parino2018,Perc2020}. The aim of this work is to quantitatively assess the effect of temporal network structure versus static aggregation on SIR epidemic outcomes, under controlled simulation experiments with identical population, activity, and disease parameters. Our central question is: How does temporal ordering in activity-driven networks constrain or enable epidemic spread compared to their aggregated counterparts?\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Epidemic and Network Model}\nWe consider a population of $N=1000$ individuals, each represented as a node in an activity-driven temporal network. At each discrete time-step, each node activates with probability $\\alpha=0.1$ and forms $m=2$ transient links to randomly chosen peers, encoding typical bursty and dynamic interaction patterns. For each timestep, all edges are dissolved and a new set of links is generated according to node activities. The time-aggregated static network is constructed by recording all contact events over $T=500$ timesteps and assigning edge weights equaling the number of observed interactions.\n\nThe disease dynamics follow the SIR compartmental model: individuals are either Susceptible (S), Infected (I), or Recovered (R). Transmission occurs along (present) edges from I to S with probability derived from the target basic reproduction number $R_0=3$, using a recovery rate $\\gamma = 1/7$ per day and resulting infection rate $\\beta = R_0 \\gamma / \\langle k \\rangle$, where $\\langle k \\rangle$ is the mean aggregated network degree ($\\approx 181.46$). Epidemics are seeded by randomly infecting 1\\% (10) of the population in both scenarios.\n\nSimulation of the static network utilizes the fastGEMF/Markov approach, while spreading on the temporal network is implemented by updating states in step with the temporal edge lists. Each epidemic run is tracked until extinction or up to 80 (static) or 500 (temporal) steps, and key statistics (peak, duration, final sizes) are extracted for systematic comparison.\n\n\\section{Results}\nSimulation outcomes reveal striking differences between the two scenarios. On the aggregated static network, the epidemic shows a rapid increase in infected individuals, peaking at approximately 325 (Fig. 1) at $t\\approx 16.47$, before subsiding, ultimately resulting in more than 950 recoveries by epidemic end ($t\\approx 69.07$). The susceptible pool is exhausted with nearly all individuals eventually infected. In dramatic contrast, the temporal activity-driven network facilities only a handful of transmission events: peak infections remain at $8$, peak at step~1, with just $10$ ultimately infected and recovered; the remainder of the population stays susceptible for the entire duration (Fig. 2).\n\nTable~\\ref{tab:sum} summarizes epidemic metrics for both cases.\n\\begin{table}[h!]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Epidemic Metrics Comparison\\label{tab:sum}}\n\\begin{tabular}{lrr}\n\\toprule\nMetric & Static Network & Temporal Network \\\\\n\\midrule\nPeak Infected & 325.40 & 8 \\\\\nPeak Time & 16.47 & 1 \\\\\nFinal Epidemic Size & 952.40 & 10 \\\\\nEpidemic End Time & 69.07 & 17 \\\\\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{table}\n\nFigures~\\ref{fig:infected-compare} and ~\\ref{fig:sir-curves} further illustrate these outcomes.\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.7\\linewidth]{comparison-infected.png}\n    \\caption{Infected count over time for static aggregated and temporal activity-driven networks.}\n    \\label{fig:infected-compare}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.7\\linewidth]{comparison-SIR.png}\n    \\caption{S, I, R compartment counts for static vs. temporal network.}\n    \\label{fig:sir-curves}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nThese results underline the critical impact of temporal ordering and network dynamics on epidemic outcomes. As supported by existing research\\cite{Moinet2018,Perra2012}, static aggregation overestimates outbreak potential by neglecting the temporal sequence and concurrency of interactions. The temporal network, by contrast, preserves causality and constrains transmission pathways, greatly impeding sustained chains of infections. Where the aggregated network acts as a dense hub facilitating mass infection, the temporal network fragments the process, allowing only sporadic or self-limited outbreaks. This difference is not just quantitative but qualitative: while individual-level exposures may be similar over long timespans, the synchrony of infection and transient nature of contacts in the temporal network fundamentally reshape the threshold and final size of the epidemic. This finding has practical consequences for modeling interventions or forecasting epidemic risk, indicating that time-resolved data and simulation are essential for accurate prediction and control.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nOur investigation demonstrates that the temporal structure of contact networks, as embodied in the activity-driven model, powerfully restrains epidemic spread compared to the simplistic predictions from time-aggregated static models. Accounting for the timing and duration of interactions is crucial for understanding, quantifying, and mitigating epidemic risks. Aggregating to static graphs may dramatically overestimate outbreak probability, speed, and final size, and could thus mislead public health responses, especially for diseases where $R_0$ hovers near the epidemic threshold.\n\n\\section*{References}\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{10}\n\n\\bibitem{Perra2012} N.
