As an illustration, we apply our framework to a two-patch SIR single-outbreak epidemic model where the process of disease invasion is connected to the final epidemic size relationship.

In this model of time-varying networks, each node is described by two variables: activity and attractiveness. The first describes the propensity to form connections, while the second defines the propensity to attract them. We derive analytically the epidemic threshold considering the time scale driving the evolution of contacts and the contagion as comparable. The solutions are general and hold for any joint distribution of activity and attractiveness. The theoretical picture is confirmed via large-scale numerical simulations performed considering heterogeneous distributions and different correlations between the two variables. We find that heterogeneous distributions of attractiveness alter the contagion process. In particular, in the case of uncorrelated and positive correlations between the two variables, heterogeneous attractiveness facilitates the spreading. On the contrary, negative correlations between activity and attractiveness hamper the spreading. The results presented contribute to the understanding of the dynamical properties of time-varying networks and their effects on contagion phenomena unfolding on their fabric.",

Building on the activity-driven network model, we propose an adaptive model of epidemic processes, where the network topology dynamically changes due to both exogenous factors independent of the epidemic dynamics as well as endogenous preventive measures adopted by individuals in response to the state of the infection. A direct analysis of the model using Markov processes involves the spectral analysis of a transition probability matrix whose size grows exponentially with the number of nodes. To overcome this limitation, we derive an upper-bound on the decay rate of the number of infected nodes in terms of the eigenvalues of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix. Using this upper bound, we propose an efficient algorithm to tune the parameters describing the endogenous preventive measures in order to contain epidemics over time. We confirm our theoretical results via numerical simulations.",

The estimation of its value with respect to the key threshold of 1.0 is a measure of the need, and eventually effectiveness, of interventions imposed in various countries. Here we present an online tool for the data driven inference and quantification of uncertainties for R0 as well as the time points of interventions for 51 European countries. The study relies on the Bayesian calibration of the simple and well established SIR model with data from reported daily infections. The model is able to fit the data for most countries without individual tuning of parameters. We deploy an open source Bayesian inference framework and efficient sampling algorithms to present a publicly available GUI (https://www.cse-lab.ethz.ch/coronavirus/) that allows the user to assess custom data and compare predictions for pairs of European countries. The results provide a ranking based on the rate of the disease's spread suggesting a metric for the effectiveness of social distancing measures. They also serve to demonstrate how geographic proximity and related times of interventions can lead to similarities in the progression of the epidemic.",

Perra et al., Sci. Rep. 2, 469 (2012)]. Building upon an analytical framework based on a mapping to hidden variables networks, we provide expressions for the percolation time Tp marking the onset of a giant connected component in the integrated network. In particular, we consider both the generating function formalism, valid for degree-uncorrelated networks, and the general case of networks with degree correlations. We discuss the different limits of the two approaches, indicating the parameter regions where the correlated threshold collapses onto the uncorrelated case. Our analytical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the model. The temporal percolation concept can be fruitfully applied to study epidemic spreading on temporal networks. We show in particular how the susceptible-infected-removed model on an activity-driven network can be mapped to the percolation problem up to a time given by the spreading rate of the epidemic process. This mapping allows us to obtain additional information on this process, not available for previous approaches.",
