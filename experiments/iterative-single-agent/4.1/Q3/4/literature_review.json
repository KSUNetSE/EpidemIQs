As an illustration, we apply our framework to a two-patch SIR single-outbreak epidemic model where the process of disease invasion is connected to the final epidemic size relationship.

To overcome this limitation, we derive an upper-bound on the decay rate of the number of infected nodes in terms of the eigenvalues of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix.

The estimation of its value with respect to the key threshold of 1.0 is a measure of the need, and eventually effectiveness, of interventions imposed in various countries. Here we present an online tool for the data driven inference and quantification of uncertainties for R0 as well as the time points of interventions for 51 European countries. The study relies on the Bayesian calibration of the simple and well established SIR model with data from reported daily infections. The model is able to fit the data for most countries without individual tuning of parameters. We deploy an open source Bayesian inference framework and efficient sampling algorithms to present a publicly available GUI (https://www.cse-lab.ethz.ch/coronavirus/) that allows the user to assess custom data and compare predictions for pairs of European countries. The results provide a ranking based on the rate of the disease's spread suggesting a metric for the effectiveness of social distancing measures. They also serve to demonstrate how geographic proximity and related times of interventions can lead to similarities in the progression of the epidemic.",

This higher-order description of the epidemic spreading is analytically formulated using a microscopic Markov chain approximation. The analysis of the fixed point solutions of the model, reveal an interesting phase transition that becomes abrupt with the infectivity parameter of the 2-simplices. Our results pave the way for network theorists to advance in our physical understanding of epidemic spreading in real scenarios where diseases are transmitted among groups as well as among pairs, and to better understand the behaviour of dynamical processes in simplicial complexes.",

                    "abstract": "The human brain is a large-scale system of functionally connected brain regions. This system can be modeled as a network, or graph, by dividing the brain into a set of regions, or \u201cnodes,\u201d and quantifying the strength of the connections between nodes, or \u201cedges,\u201d as the temporal correlation in their patterns of activity. Network analysis, a part of graph theory, provides a set of summary statistics that can be used to describe complex brain networks in a meaningful way. The large-scale organization of the brain has features of complex networks that can be quantified using network measures from graph theory. The adaptation of both bivariate (mutual information) and multivariate (Granger causality) connectivity estimators to quantify the synchronization between multichannel recordings yields a fully connected, weighted, (a)symmetric functional connectivity graph (FCG), representing the associations among all brain areas. The aforementioned procedure leads to an extremely dense network of tens up to a few hundreds of weights. Therefore, this FCG must be filtered out so that the \u201ctrue\u201d connectivity pattern can emerge. Here, we compared a large number of well-known topological thresholding techniques with the novel proposed data-driven scheme based on orthogonal minimal spanning trees (OMSTs). OMSTs filter brain connectivity networks based on the optimization between the global efficiency of the network and the cost preserving its wiring. We demonstrated the proposed method in a large EEG database (N = 101 subjects) with eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) tasks by adopting a time-varying approach with the main goal to extract features that can totally distinguish each subject from the rest of the set. Additionally, the reliability of the proposed scheme was estimated in a second case study of fMRI resting-state activity with multiple scans. Our results demonstrated clearly that the proposed thresholding scheme outperformed a large list of thresholding schemes based on the recognition accuracy of each subject compared to the rest of the cohort (EEG). Additionally, the reliability of the network metrics based on the fMRI static networks was improved based on the proposed topological filtering scheme. Overall, the proposed algorithm could be used across neuroimaging and multimodal studies as a common computationally efficient standardized tool for a great number of neuroscientists and physicists working on numerous of projects.",

Machine learning techniques are used to reliably predict joint mechanics directly from streams of IMU signals for various activities. These data-driven models require comprehensive and representative training datasets to be generalizable across the movement variability seen in the population at large. Bottlenecks in model development frequently occur due to the lack of sufficient training data and the significant time and resources necessary to acquire these datasets. Reliable methods to generate synthetic biomechanical training data could streamline model development and potentially improve model performance. In this study, we developed a methodology to generate synthetic kinematics and the associated predicted IMU signals using open source musculoskeletal modeling software. These synthetic data were used to train neural networks to predict three degree-of-freedom joint rotations at the hip and knee during gait either in lieu of or along with previously measured experimental gait data. The accuracy of the models\u2019 kinematic predictions was assessed using experimentally measured IMU signals and gait kinematics. Models trained using the synthetic data out-performed models using only the experimental data in five of the six rotational degrees of freedom at the hip and knee. On average, root mean square errors in joint angle predictions were improved by 38% at the hip (synthetic data RMSE: 2.3\u00b0, measured data RMSE: 4.5\u00b0) and 11% at the knee (synthetic data RMSE: 2.9\u00b0, measured data RMSE: 3.3\u00b0), when models trained solely on synthetic data were compared to measured data. When models were trained on both measured and synthetic data, root mean square errors were reduced by 54% at the hip (measured + synthetic data RMSE: 1.9\u00b0) and 45% at the knee (measured + synthetic data RMSE: 1.7\u00b0), compared to measured data alone. These findings enable future model development for different activities of clinical significance without the burden of generating large quantities of gait lab data for model training, streamlining model development, and ultimately improving model performance.",

Traditional VS researches mostly target at the effectiveness of the VS algorithms by introducing the high quality of features and clusters for selecting representative visual elements. Due to the increased density of vision sensors network, there is a tradeoff between the processing time of the VS methods with reasonable and representative quality of the generated summaries. It is a challenging task to generate a video summary of significant importance while fulfilling the needs of Internet of Things (IoT) surveillance networks with constrained resources. This article addresses this problem by proposing a new computationally effective solution through designing a deep CNN framework with hierarchical weighted fusion for the summarization of surveillance videos captured in IoT settings. The first stage of our framework designs discriminative rich features extracted from deep CNNs for shot segmentation. Then, we employ image memorability predicted from a fine-tuned CNN model in the framework, along with aesthetic and entropy features to maintain the interestingness and diversity of the summary. Third, a hierarchical weighted fusion mechanism is proposed to produce an aggregated score for the effective computation of the extracted features. Finally, an attention curve is constituted using the aggregated score for deciding outstanding keyframes for the final video summary. Experiments are conducted using benchmark data sets for validating the importance and effectiveness of our framework, which outperforms the other state-of-the-art schemes.",

According to wildlife researchers, visual information provides definitive evidence of an animal\u2019s distribution patterns and activity within an environmental context. At the Department of Biology and The Ingram School of Engineering at Texas State University and Texas A&M University, we collaborated on a camera trap project to monitor species from images in Texas, USA. We developed a framework to analyze the acquired images using artificial intelligence-driven technology and computer vision methods. The project aims to classify three broad groups of herpetofaunal species (i.e., toads/frogs, lizards, and snakes) from camera trap images with deep learning architectures. The experiment includes balancing the imbalanced dataset, investigating several image preprocessing techniques, and augmentation procedures. The classification results present tremendous prospects for automated species identification from challenging biological image data. The research outcome is essential to the academic community and wildlife researchers for conservation and monitoring purpose. Abstract Accurate identification of animal species is necessary to understand biodiversity richness, monitor endangered species, and study the impact of climate change on species distribution within a specific region. Camera traps represent a passive monitoring technique that generates millions of ecological images. The vast numbers of images drive automated ecological analysis as essential, given that manual assessment of large datasets is laborious, time-consuming, and expensive. Deep learning networks have been advanced in the last few years to solve object and species identification tasks in the computer vision domain, providing state-of-the-art results. In our work, we trained and tested machine learning models to classify three animal groups (snakes, lizards, and toads) from camera trap images. We experimented with two pretrained models, VGG16 and ResNet50, and a self-trained convolutional neural network (CNN-1) with varying CNN layers and augmentation parameters. For multiclassification, CNN-1 achieved 72% accuracy, whereas VGG16 reached 87%, and ResNet50 attained 86% accuracy. These results demonstrate that the transfer learning approach outperforms the self-trained model performance. The models showed promising results in identifying species, especially those with challenging body sizes and vegetation.",

The proposed supervised method uses the spiking activity provided by an arbitrary topology of prior SNN layers to build histograms and train the classifier in the frame domain using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. In addition, this approach can cope with leaky integrate-and-fire neuron models within the SNN, a desirable feature for real-world SNN applications, where neural activation must fade away after some time in the absence of inputs. Consequently, this way of building histograms captures the dynamics of spikes immediately before the classifier. We tested our method on the MNIST data set using different synthetic encodings and real DVS sensory data sets such as N-MNIST, MNIST-DVS, and Poker-DVS using the same network topology and feature maps. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving the highest classification accuracy reported on the N-MNIST (97.77%) and Poker-DVS (100%) real DVS data sets to date with a spiking convolutional network. Moreover, by using the proposed method we were able to retrain the output layer of a previously reported spiking neural network and increase its performance by 2%, suggesting that the proposed classifier can be used as the output layer in works where features are extracted using unsupervised spike-based learning methods. In addition, we also analyze SNN performance figures such as total event activity and network latencies, which are relevant for eventual hardware implementations. In summary, the paper aggregates unsupervised-trained SNNs with a supervised-trained SNN classifier, combining and applying them to heterogeneous sets of benchmarks, both synthetic and from real DVS chips.",

                    "abstract": "African Swine Fever (ASF) has been slowly but steadily increasing its endemic range throughout Europe, posing an imminent risk to the pig industry. ASF transmission among wild boar occurs mainly through wild boar population movements, hence wild boar presence and density are important risk factors for introducing, maintaining, and spreading the disease. The understanding of wild boar population dynamics and their role in ASF transmission and persistence remains limited. It is crucial to gain knowledge in this area to improve wildlife management while minimizing the risks for ASF introduction and spread. We adapted an individual-based spatio-temporal stochastic model developed by Halasa et al. (2019) and tailored it to two regions in France. The model assessed yearly hunting activity, the carcass persistence seasonality, and the specific landscape characteristics of the Franco-Belgian border region and the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques department. Following the establishment of local population dynamics through preliminary runs of the model, the model was run 100 iterations over 8 years in the two study areas where ASF was randomly seeded after the 2nd year of simulation. For each scenario, the model was initiated with 500 wild boar groups randomly spread across the study areas. Hunting activities were included and excluded to assess the impact on population growth and ASF spread. Results showed an ever-growing wild boar population for all scenarios, which was balanced when hunting activities were included. When introducing ASF, the wild boar populations were dramatically impacted in both areas with a decrease of 63 % of the population at the Franco-Belgian border and 86 % in the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques department. Habitat fragmentation and landscape connectivity were highlighted as important factors shaping ASF propagation. The Franco-Belgian border, which had the most fragmented habitat with unsuitable areas for wild boars, was shown to limit wild boar movements, reducing the probability, and spread of ASF across the landscape. The lack of connectivity was reflected in a less effective transmission and lower number of infected groups (406 versus 467). In contrast, the epidemic duration was lengthened in the fragmented habitat compared to the homogenous area (2.6 years vs 1.6 years). This study provided information on defining and implementing control measures in case of an ASF incursion, since delimitation of the area via fences artificially induces landscape fragmentation, which is important for controlling ASF outbreaks.",
