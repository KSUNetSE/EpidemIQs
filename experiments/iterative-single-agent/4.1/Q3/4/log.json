This paper investigates how an infectious disease, modeled via the Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) framework with a basic reproduction number $R_0 = 3$, propagates through an activity-driven temporal network of 1000 nodes---where each node activates with probability $\\alpha=0.1$ and forms $m=2$ instantaneous contacts---in comparison to its time-aggregated static counterpart in which edge weights represent contact frequencies. Through simulation and quantitative analysis, we find that the temporal ordering and sparsity of interactions in the activity-driven scenario significantly diminish outbreak severity and peak infection compared to the static network, even under identical $R_0$, highlighting the critical importance of temporal effects for epidemic prediction and control.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n%------------------ INTRODUCTION -----------------\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe spread of infectious diseases depends sensitively on the structure of contact networks over which transmission occurs \\cite{PastorSatorras2015, Holme2012, Masuda2016}. Traditional epidemic models, such as the SIR framework, are often analyzed on static graphs that aggregate all contacts over a period, ignoring the order and timing of interactions. However, real-world contact patterns are dynamic, with temporally fluctuating activity and intermittent ties that may strongly alter outbreak trajectories \\cite{Perra2012, Starnini2013, Karsai2011}.\n\nA canonical paradigm for temporal networks is the activity-driven model \\cite{Perra2012}, in which each of $N$ nodes is assigned an intrinsic activity rate, and at each time step, active nodes form a small number $m$ of transient edges. In this system, the instantaneous network is sparse and rapidly changing, potentially limiting the ability of pathogens to traverse the network compared to a weighted static representation where all links (regardless of when they occurred) are always active.\n\nRecent studies have argued that aggregation of contacts can lead to a dramatic overestimation of epidemic size and speed; specifically, the temporal structure can create bottlenecks that restrict the flow of infection, even for the same average number of contacts and a fixed $R_0$ \\cite{Holme2015, Valdano2015}. Yet, the quantitative impact of these effects for SIR epidemics on activity-driven versus static networks, for identical population and $R_0$, remains an open and practically relevant question.\n\nIn this work, we address this question through a computational experiment. We simulate SIR dynamics (with $R_0=3$) in both an activity-driven temporal network and its aggregated static counterpart, where connections are weighted by frequency of past interactions, for $N=1000$, $\\alpha=0.1$, $m=2$. By analyzing epidemic curves, peak infection, outbreak duration, and final epidemic size, we elucidate the substantial influence of temporal network features---specifically, the ordering and concurrency of contacts---on disease spread. Our results highlight the potential pitfalls of using static network representations for infectious disease forecasting in dynamic populations.\n\n%----------------- REFERENCES (INITIAL) -----------\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\n\\bibitem{PastorSatorras2015} R.
