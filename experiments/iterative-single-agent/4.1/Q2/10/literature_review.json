                    "abstract": "The summary measurement of an epidemic such as the final size is an important quantity that allows us to approximate the impact of the disease on the affected region. In recent years, final size measurements for vector-transmitted diseases have acquired importance because of the increased concern for mosquito-borne diseases like dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, etc. However, analytical expressions for this estimate in the stage-structured models applicable to vector-borne diseases are less, mostly focused on the classical Kermack\u2013McKendrick model. In this paper, we first calculate the final size expressions for an SIR model with carrier state and a SEIR\u2013SI host\u2013vector model. Then we extend this for the SEIR\u2013SI host\u2013vector model with treatment class in the host, as well as for the model with vertical transmission in the vector population. Finally, we verify our final size expression with some real scenarios.",

Their inducing epidemics last longer, have a higher number of asymptomatic cases, and are more serious. In this article, we proposed a nonautonomous time-delayed susceptible-infected-removed (NATD-SIR) model to predict them in different regions of China. We obtained the maximum and its time of current infected persons, the final size, and the end time of COVID-19 epidemics from January 2022 in China. The method of the fifth-order moving average was used to preprocess the time series of the numbers of current infected and removed cases to obtain more accurate parameter estimations. We found that usually the transmission rate $ \\beta(t) $ was a piecewise exponential decay function, but due to multiple bounces in Shanghai City, $ \\beta(t) $ was approximately a piecewise quadratic function. In most regions, the removed rate $ \\gamma(t) $ was approximately equal to a piecewise linear increasing function of (a*t+b)*H(t-k), but in a few areas, $ \\gamma(t) $ displayed an exponential increasing trend. For cases where the removed rate cannot be obtained, we proposed a method for setting the removed rate, which has a good approximation. Using the numerical solution, we obtained the prediction results of the epidemics. By analyzing those important indicators of COVID-19, we provided valuable suggestions for epidemic prevention and control and the resumption of work and production.",

                    "abstract": "Background Facing a global epidemic of new infectious diseases such as COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), which reduce transmission rates without medical actions, are being implemented around the world to mitigate spreads. One of the problems in assessing the effects of NPIs is that different NPIs have been implemented at different times based on the situation of each country; therefore, few assumptions can be shared about how the introduction of policies affects the patient population. Mathematical models can contribute to further understanding these phenomena by obtaining analytical solutions as well as numerical simulations. Methods and results In this study, an NPI was introduced into the SIR model for a conceptual study of infectious diseases under the condition that the transmission rate was reduced to a fixed value only once within a finite time duration, and its effect was analyzed numerically and theoretically. It was analytically shown that the maximum fraction of infected individuals and the final size could be larger if the intervention starts too early. The analytical results also suggested that more individuals may be infected at the peak of the second wave with a stronger intervention. Conclusions This study provides quantitative relationship between the strength of a one-shot intervention and the reduction in the number of patients with no approximation. This suggests the importance of the strength and time of NPIs, although detailed studies are necessary for the implementation of NPIs in complicated real-world environments as the model used in this study is based on various simplifications.",

                    "abstract": "Simple Summary Predicting the spreading trend of the COVID-19 epidemic is one of the hot topics in the modeling field. In this study, we applied a continuous Markov-chain model to simulate the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. The results of this study indicate that the herd immunity threshold should be significantly higher than 1 \u2212 1/R0. Taking the immunity waning effect into consideration, the model could predict an epidemic resurgence after the herd immunity threshold. Meanwhile, this Markov-chain approach could also forecast the epidemic distribution and predict the epidemic hotspots at different times. It is implied from our model that it is significantly challenging to eradicate SARS-CoV-2 in the short term. The actual epidemic development is consistent with our prediction. In the end, this method displayed great potential as an alternative approach to traditional compartment models. Abstract To address the urgent need to accurately predict the spreading trend of the COVID-19 epidemic, a continuous Markov-chain model was, for the first time, developed in this work to predict the spread of COVID-19 infection. A probability matrix of infection was first developed in this model based upon the contact frequency of individuals within the population, the individual\u2019s characteristics, and other factors that can effectively reflect the epidemic\u2019s temporal and spatial variation characteristics. The Markov-chain model was then extended to incorporate both the mutation effect of COVID-19 and the decaying effect of antibodies. The developed comprehensive Markov-chain model that integrates the aforementioned factors was finally tested by real data to predict the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic. The result shows that our model can effectively avoid the prediction dilemma that may exist with traditional ordinary differential equations model, such as the susceptible\u2013infectious\u2013recovered (SIR) model. Meanwhile, it can forecast the epidemic distribution and predict the epidemic hotspots geographically at different times. It is also demonstrated in our result that the influence of the population\u2019s spatial and geographic distribution in a herd infection event is needed in the model for a better prediction of the epidemic trend. At the same time, our result indicates that no simple derivative relationship exists between the threshold of herd immunity and the virus basic reproduction number R0. The threshold of herd immunity achieved through natural immunity is significantly higher than 1 \u2212 1/R0. These not only explain the theoretical misconceptions of herd immunity thresholds in herd immunity theory but also provide a guidance for predicting the optimal vaccination coverage. In addition, our model can predict the temporal and spatial distribution of infections in different epidemic waves. It is implied from our model that it is challenging to eradicate COVID-19 in the short term for a large population size and a wide spatial distribution. It is predicted that COVID-19 is likely to coexist with humans for a long time and that it will exhibit multipoint epidemic effects at a later stage. The statistical evidence is consistent with our prediction and strongly supports our modeling results.",

All possible pathways of the interaction between cationic species [Cp2ZrMe+] and counteranions, [A\u2212] = [MeB(C6F5)3]\u2212 and [B(C6F5)4]\u2212, were examined during chain initiation, propagation, and termination steps. The calculations reveal an active chain-end mechanism with O-alkyl bond cleavage of the polymerisation. The catalytic performance of the two counteranions is found to be identical, and they influence the initial process through stabilisation of the cationic species via non-covalent interactions (NCI), with the [MeB(C6F5)3]\u2212 anion stabilising the catalyst\u2013monomer complex more effectively than the [B(C6F5)4]\u2212 anion by 24.3 kJ mol\u22121. The first two propagations are likely the rate-determining step, with calculated free-energy barriers of 61.4\u201371.2 and 73.9\u201380.6 kJ mol\u22121 with and without the anions (A\u2212), respectively. The presence of the counteranion significantly affects the third propagation rate, lowering the barriers up to 20 kJ mol\u22121. Comparison of the first termination and the third propagation shows that they are not competitive, with the termination being less facile. We also studied the initiation and propagation steps for the hafnocene catalyst and found that the Hf catalyst slightly favours the CL CROP in comparison to the Zr catalyst. Analysis of solvent and dispersion interaction demonstrates that both factors play an important role in the process. NCI analysis reveals weak (van der Waals) interactions at the contacts between the cationic species and the counteranions during the reaction course.

The molecular structures of Fe2 and Fe3 were determined by X-ray diffraction, revealing a pseudo-square-pyramidal geometry. High activities were achieved toward ethylene polymerization in each iron complex case. The sterically least demanding ligand enhanced the activity of its complex Fe1 with the highest activity up to 16.8 \u00d7 106 g of PE (mol of Fe)-1 h-1at 70 \u00b0C, while the bulkiest ligand led to the formation of the highest molecular weight of the resulting polyethylene using Fe6. Generally, the resulting polyethylenes are highly linear and most of them have a tendency to display bimodal distributions by virtue of the presence of multiple sites or competing chain transfer reactions.

A\u03b240 and A\u03b242, as two most prominent isoforms of A\u03b2 peptides, can cross-interact with each other and form co-aggregates, which affect the progression of the disease. However, the molecular determinants underlying A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 cross-interaction and the structural details of their co-oligomers remain elusive. Herein, we performed all-atom explicit-solvent replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations on A\u03b240-A\u03b242 heterogeneous and A\u03b240/A\u03b242 homogeneous dimer systems to dissect the co-aggregation mechanisms of the two isoforms. Our results show that the interpeptide main-chain interaction of A\u03b240-A\u03b242 is stronger than that of A\u03b240-A\u03b240 and A\u03b242-A\u03b242. The positions of hotspot residues in heterodimers and homodimers display high similarity, implying similar molecular recognition sites for both cross-interaction and self-interaction. Contact maps of A\u03b240-A\u03b242 heterodimers reveal that residue pairs crucial for cross-interaction are mostly located in the C-terminal hydrophobic regions of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 peptides. Conformational analysis shows that A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 monomers can co-assemble into \u03b2-sheet-rich heterodimers with shorter \u03b2-sheets than those in homodimers, which is decremental to monomer addition. Similar molecular recognition sites and \u03b2-sheet distribution of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 peptides are observed in heterodimers and homodimers, which may provide the molecular basis for the two isoforms' co-aggregation and cross-seeding. Our work dissects the co-aggregation mechanisms of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 peptides at the atomic level, which will help for in-depth understanding of the cross-talk between the two A\u03b2 isoforms and the pathogenesis of AD.",

In this mini-review, the recent discovery of two unprecedented chain termination processes is summarized: chain transfer to solvent (CTS) and chain transfer to monomer (CTM), leading to benzyl/tolyl and allyl type chain ends, respectively. Although similar transfer reactions are well-known in radical polymerization, only very recently they have been observed also in olefin insertion polymerization catalysis. In the latter context, these processes were first identified in Ti-catalyzed propene and ethene polymerization; more recently, CTS was also reported in Sc-catalyzed styrene polymerization. In the Ti case, these processes represent a unique combination of insertion polymerization, organic radical chemistry and reactivity of a M(IV)/M(III) redox couple. In the Sc case, CTS occurs via a \u03c3-bond metathesis reactivity, and it is associated with a significant boost of catalytic activity and/or with tuning of polystyrene molecular weight and tacticity. The mechanistic studies that led to the understanding of these chain transfer reactions are summarized, highlighting their relevance in olefin polymerization catalysis and beyond.",

Indirect effects arise when vaccinated individuals block disease transmission in any infection chain they are part of, and this in turn can benefit both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Indirect effects are difficult to quantify in practice but, in this article, working with the susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered (SIR) model, they are analytically calculated in important cases, through pivoting on the final size formula for epidemics. Their relationship to herd immunity is also clarified. The analysis allows us to identify the important distinction between quantifying the indirect effects of vaccination at the \u2018population level\u2019 versus the \u2018per capita\u2019 level, which often results in radically different conclusions. As an example, our analysis unpacks why the population-level indirect effect can appear significantly larger than its per capita analogue. In addition, we consider a recently proposed epidemiological non-pharmaceutical intervention (by the means of recovered individuals) used over the COVID-19 pandemic, referred to as \u2018shielding\u2019, and study its impact on our mathematical analysis.

It is well known that treatment can have a specific effect on the spread of epidemics, and due to the limited resources of treatment, the number of patients during severe disease outbreaks who need to be treated may exceed the treatment capacity. Consequently, the number of patients who receive treatment will reach a saturation level. Thus, we incorporated a saturated treatment function into the model to characterize such a phenomenon. The dynamics of the present model is discussed in this paper. We first obtained a threshold value R0, which determines the stability of a disease-free equilibrium. Furthermore, we investigated the bifurcation behavior at R0=1. More specifically, we derived a condition that determines the direction of bifurcation at R0=1. If the direction is backward, then a stable disease-free equilibrium concurrently exists with a stable endemic equilibrium even though R0<1. Therefore, in this case, R0<1 is not sufficient to eradicate the disease from the population. However, if the direction is forward, we find that for a range of parameters, multiple equilibria could exist to the left and right of R0=1. In this case, the initial infectious invasion must be controlled to a lower level so that the disease dies out or approaches a lower endemic steady state.",

The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Hospitalized-Critical-Deaths (SEIR-HCD) model proposed in this research work is identified as a valuable tool for capturing the complex dynamics of disease transmission, healthcare demands, and mortality rates during epidemics.\n\nBackground: The spread of viral diseases is a major problem for public health services all over the world. Understanding how diseases spread is important in order to take the right steps to stop them. In epidemiology, the SIS, SIR, and SEIR models have been used to mimic and study how diseases spread in groups of people.\n\nMethodology: This research focuses on the integration of air traffic network data into the SEIR-HCD model to enhance the understanding of disease spread in air travel settings. By incorporating air traffic data, the model considers the role of travel patterns and connectivity in disease dissemination, enabling the identification of high-risk routes, airports, and regions.\n\nContribution: This research contributes to the field of epidemiology by enhancing our understanding of disease spread dynamics through the application of the SIS, SIR, and SEIR-HCD models. The findings provide insights into the factors influencing disease transmission, allowing for the development of effective strategies for disease control and prevention.\n\nFindings: The interplay between local outbreaks and global disease dissemination through air travel is empirically explored. The model can be further used for the evaluation of the effectiveness of surveillance and early detection measures at airports and transportation hubs. The proposed research contributes to proactive and evidence-based strategies for disease prevention and control, offering insights into the impact of air travel on disease transmission and supporting public health interventions in air traffic networks.\n\nRecommendations for Practitioners: Government intervention can be studied during difficult times which plays as a moderating variable that can enhance or hinder the efficacy of epidemic intelligence efforts within air traffic networks. Expert collaboration from various fields, including epidemiology, aviation, data science, and public health with an interdisciplinary approach can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the disease spread dynamics in air traffic networks. \n\nRecommendation for Researchers: Researchers can collaborate with international health organizations and authorities to share their research findings and contribute to a global understanding of disease spread in air traffic networks.\n\nImpact on Society: This research has significant implications for society. By providing a deeper understanding of disease spread dynamics, it enables policymakers, public health officials, and practitioners to make informed decisions to mitigate disease outbreaks. The recommendations derived from this research can aid in the development of effective strategies to control and prevent the spread of infectious diseases, ultimately leading to improved public health outcomes and reduced societal disruptions.\n\nFuture Research: Practitioners of the research can contribute more effectively to disease outbreaks within the context of air traffic networks, ultimately helping to protect public health and global travel. By considering air traffic patterns, the SEIR-HCD model contributes to more accurate modeling and prediction of disease outbreaks, aiding in the development of proactive and evidence-based strategies to manage and mitigate the impact of infectious diseases in the context of air travel.\n\n",

The IoT uses smart objects which are embedded into the environment and interact by transmitting several messages which interference with other messages on receiving nodes. This can lead to inevitable sensors\u2019 (nodes\u2019) deterioration after transmitting a considerable number of messages. Interference mitigation In a complex network such as the IoT is still a subject of active research which could benefit many real-world applications. Collection trees algorithms and protocols can be used adopted to reduce the interference on the nodes/paths of an IoT network but but can not fully stop or avoid interference across an IoT network. Building upon a mapping between path interference on devices (nodes) and real life contamination of a disease that can move an individual from a susceptible (S) to infected (I) and replaced (R) statuses, this paper revisits the collection tree algorithms with the objective of studying the dynamics of the interference in IoT networks. In this study, the IoT network\u2019s nodes are partitioned into mutually exclusive groups based on possible epidemic spread. For each group, an SIR model is proposed in a form of a system of difference equations. The model is analysed by studying the system stability and simulations are used to study the real time status of the interference across the network.",

We show that the diffusion is not described by the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, but rather by a new model, the Bass-SIR model, which combines the Bass model for diffusion of new products with the SIR model for epidemics. The phase transition of consumers from nonadopters to adopters is described by a nonstandard Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model, in which clusters growth is limited by adopters' recovery. Therefore, diffusion in the Bass-SIR model only depends on the local structure of the social network, but not on the average distance between consumers. Consequently, unlike the SIR model, a small-worlds structure has a negligible effect on the diffusion. Moreover, unlike the SIR model, there is no threshold value above which the diffusion will peter out. Surprisingly, diffusion on scale-free networks is nearly identical to that on Cartesian ones.",

In recent years, the research community has acquired strong evidences of complex and heterogeneous connections and diverse patterns in a variety of real human contact networks. The heterogeneity of network topologies has a deep influence on understanding the spreading dynamics of disease. In the process of infection spread, network edges are the critical communication channels. Many existing approaches for identifying prominent nodes in such networks rely on node attributes. Further, in unweighted networks, all the edges are considered to be equal, which imposes an unrealistic assumption for epidemic spreading through frequent interactions between humans. Here, we present an edge weighting technique, named as, Weighted Hybrid Centrality $\\left( {{W_{{C_H}}}} \\right)$, that takes into account multiple centrality indicators, including degree, k-shell, and eigenvector centrality, as well as the frequency of interactions be-tween any two users (nodes) which is considered as potential edge weight. To analyze the performance of ${W_{{C_H}}}$, we have utilized the weighted susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered (W-SIR) simulator and have carried out a comparative experiment on six real-world heterogeneous networks. The proposed technique outperforms the baseline methods with 0.067 to 0.641 averaged Kendall\u2019s \u03c4 score.

For the sake of dealing with this problem, there are three models being developed. Firstly, this paper establishes the model 1 on the basis of the classical model of SIR and diffusion characteristic of Ebola virus. It verifies the reduction of the spread of the virus, the improvement of the patient\u2019s cure rate and the effectiveness of three preventive measures which are significant in the formation of herd immunity. At the same time, we use linear programming to control the cost of drug delivery. Model 2, namely, the model of SIR with pulse vaccination, provides a pulse vaccination therapy on the basis of model 1. Model 2 considers many factors comprehensively, such as the cycle of inoculation, vaccination rate, the birth rate, death rate and so on. We use differential equation models to get the critical condition of the number of susceptible people, vaccination rate, and the development of predicated estimate with the change of time. Next, based on the model 2, we establish model 3 which not only considers many factors comprehensively, such as the amount of supply, the location of supply and so on, but also introduce 0-1 variable to combine the general linear programming with another linear programming which is not fixed but multi objectives so that we get the drug delivery network. Meanwhile, this paper obtains the best drug delivery program which has to spend the minimum cost on the condition of effectively controlling the epidemic. Also the result can alleviate serious situation of the Ebola virus epidemic diffusion through the drug delivery network. This paper puts forward the improvement of the model by using the Self-Organizing Map neural network and cluster analysis to get the urgent degree of different epidemic areas and divide these areas into different priorities. We get a goal programming model based on different priority. Furthermore, we use the drug delivery model and Lingo to get a more reliable drug delivery program on the basis of the objective function of priority.",

Based on the UAU-SIR model, we additionally consider three practical factors, including whether individuals will disseminate information or not, the influence of unaware individuals on aware individuals, and the direct recovery of asymptomatic infected individuals. Based on the microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA), for the proposed HTUA-SI^{a}I^{s}R model, MMCA equations\u00a0are generated and the analytical expression of the epidemic threshold is obtained. Compared with Monte Carlo techniques, numerical simulations show the feasibility and effectiveness of the MMCA equations, as well as the HTUA-SI^{a}I^{s}R model theoretically. Meanwhile, extensive simulations demonstrate that the acceleration of the awareness dissemination in the virtual communication layer can effectively block the epidemic spreading and raise the epidemic threshold. However, under certain conditions, the increasing of T-state individuals will increase the U-state individuals because the T-state and U-state individuals can influence the A-state individuals losing their awareness of protection, and then promote the epidemic spreading and decrease the epidemic threshold. In addition, reducing asymptomatic infections can hinder the epidemic spreading. But, when the recovery rate of asymptomatic infections is greater than that of symptomatic infections, decreasing the tendency of individuals acquiring asymptomatic infections will lower the epidemic threshold.",

Indirect effects arise when vaccinated individuals block disease transmission in any infection chain they are part of, and this in turn can benefit both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Indirect effects are difficult to quantify in practice but, in this article, working with the susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered (SIR) model, they are analytically calculated in important cases, through pivoting on the final size formula for epidemics. Their relationship to herd immunity is also clarified. The analysis allows us to identify the important distinction between quantifying the indirect effects of vaccination at the \u2018population level\u2019 versus the \u2018per capita\u2019 level, which often results in radically different conclusions. As an example, our analysis unpacks why the population-level indirect effect can appear significantly larger than its per capita analogue. In addition, we consider a recently proposed epidemiological non-pharmaceutical intervention (by the means of recovered individuals) used over the COVID-19 pandemic, referred to as \u2018shielding\u2019, and study its impact on our mathematical analysis. The shielding scheme is extended to take advantage of vaccination including imperfect vaccination.",

However, these models typically assume that populations are homogeneously mixed, ignoring possible variations in disease prevalence due to spatial heterogeneity. To address this issue, reaction-diffusion models have been proposed as an alternative approach to modeling spatially continuous populations in which individuals move in a diffusive manner. In this study, we explore the conditions under which such spatial structure must be explicitly considered to accurately predict disease spread, and when the assumption of homogeneous mixing remains adequate. In particular, we derive a critical threshold for the diffusion coefficient below which disease transmission dynamics exhibit spatial heterogeneity. We validate our analytical results with individual-based simulations of disease transmission across a two-dimensional continuous landscape. Using this framework, we further explore how key epidemiological parameters such as the probability of disease establishment, its maximum incidence, and its final epidemic size are affected by incorporating spatial structure into SI, SIS, and SIR models.

To approximate the expected dynamics of these processes, we employ a mean-field technique known as the N-Intertwined Mean-Field Approximation (NIMFA). Our primary goal is to quantify the impact of the randomness in the network topology on the accuracy of such approximations. While classical work by Kurtz established strong approximation results for density-dependent Markov chains using mean-field on the complete-graph of order $N$, yielding error bounds of order $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}$, we demonstrate that in the context of NIMFA on random graphs, the error admits a refined characterization depending on initial conditions. Specifically, for generic initial conditions, the worst case error is of order $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d}}$, where $d$ is the expected average degree of the graph. This result highlights how network sparsity contributes an additional source of variability not captured by classical mean-field approaches. Furthermore, when the initial conditions are taken to be fairly homogeneous, we show that the error term is of order $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}+\\frac{1}{d}$, where $N$ is the number of nodes, underscoring the intricate role of the choice of initial conditions in the error bounds.

Such epidemics are described by $2^n$- or $3^n$-state Markov chains. Ostensibly, because analyzing such Markov chains is too complicated, their $O(n)$-dimensional nonlinear \"mean-field\" approximation, and its linearization, are often studied instead. We provide a complete global analysis of the epidemic dynamics of the nonlinear mean-field approximation. In particular, we show that depending on the largest eigenvalue of the underlying graph adjacency matrix and the rates of infection, recovery, and vaccination, the global dynamics takes on one of two forms: either the epidemic dies out, or it converges to another unique fixed point (the so-called endemic state where a constant fraction of the nodes remain infected). A similar result has also been shown in the continuous-time case. We tie in these results with the \"true\" underlying Markov chain model by showing that the linear model is the tightest upper-bound on the true probabilities of infection that involves only marginals, and that, even though the nonlinear model is not an upper-bound on the true probabilities in general, it does provide an upper-bound on the probability of the chain not being absorbed. As a consequence, we also show that when the disease-free fixed point is globally stable for the mean-field model, the Markov chain has an $O(\\log n)$ mixing time, which means the epidemic dies out quickly.

In this model, vertices are either susceptible, infected, or recovered. Each infected vertex becomes recovered at rate 1 and infects each of its susceptible neighbors independently at rate $\\lambda$, and each recovered vertex becomes susceptible at a rate $\\varrho$, which we assume to be independent of the graph size. A central quantity of the SIRS process is the time until no vertex is infected, known as the survival time. Surprisingly though, rigorous theoretical results exist only for the related SIS model so far. We address this imbalance by conducting theoretical analyses of the SIRS process via their expansion properties. We prove that the expected survival time of the SIRS process on stars is at most polynomial in the graph size for any value of $\\lambda$. This behavior is fundamentally different from the SIS process, where the expected survival time is exponential already for small infection rates. Our main result is an exponential lower bound of the expected survival time of the SIRS process on expander graphs. Specifically, we show that on expander graphs $G$ with $n$ vertices, degree close to $d$, and sufficiently small spectral expansion, the SIRS process has expected survival time at least exponential in $n$ when $\\lambda \\geq c/d$ for a constant $c>1$. Previous results on the SIS process show that this bound is almost tight. Additionally, our result holds even if $G$ is a subgraph. Notably, our result implies an almost-tight threshold for Erdos-R\\'enyi graphs and a regime of exponential survival time for hyperbolic random graphs. The proof of our main result draws inspiration from Lyapunov functions used in mean-field theory to devise a two-dimensional potential function and applying a negative-drift theorem to show that the expected survival time is exponential.",

                    "abstract": "This study demonstrated the duration of immunity over 6 months of a vaccine against key bovine respiratory disease pathogens: Parainfluenza 3, Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Bovine Viral Diarrhoea and Mannheimia haemolytica. This was performed by challenge on colostrumdeprived calves at the age of 2 weeks. Recent European field isolates were used as challenge strains. Clinical signs and pathogen excretion or presence were monitored. Field relevance of the viral challenge strains was analysed using phylogenic analysis. Significant reduction of excretion of the 3 viruses in vaccinated animals was a consistent finding, demonstrating the efficacy of the vaccine. Reducing shedding is indeed key to interrupting the infection transmission chain and helping to achieve the protective effects of immunisation that extend beyond the individual. A significant reduction of clinical signs and lung lesions following the Mannheimia haemolytica challenge was also observed in vaccinated animals versus controls. Comparison of the challenge strains to an array of global and European strains, including recent ones, demonstrated a high genetic proximity, supporting the potential for the vaccine to maintain similar levels of efficacy in the field over a 6-month period post vaccination. Cattle, immunization, Parainfluenza 3, Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Bovine Viral Diarrhoea, Mannheimia haemolytica Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) is a multifactorial disease impacting cattle production. The disease is often referred to as a disease complex, involving both bacterial and viral pathogens as well as psychological (e.g. stress) and physical (e.g. air quality and temperature) factors in various combinations. It is recognized as having a major impact on the health and economics of beef and dairy production and is considered as the most important illness associated with feedlot cattle in the USA (Snowder et al. 2006) and possibly worldwide (Horwood et al. 2008). Bovine Respiratory Disease is a relatively common phenomenon in younger cattle, especially those housed in intensive conditions, with vaccination programmes against BRD commencing on some farms in calves as young as 2 weeks of age. The importance of the disease in young calves and growing animals requires the vaccines and programmes used from the outset to be as effective and appropriate as possible. The vaccine antigens being used need to be appropriate for the strains currently (and at risk of) circulating on farms. They also need to be presented efficiently to the vaccinated animal so as to ensure both an optimal primary vaccination course response and a long duration of protective immunity. The immuno-competence of vaccinated calves and the level of circulating maternally-derived colostral antibodies (MDA) present can also have an impact on the vaccination response. These factors and the specifics of the disease dynamics on farm are all important when determining the right vaccination approach.

As per regulatory requirements, colostrum deprived calves were used, hence the study did not consider the relevance of and approaches for MDAs. This study confirms the efficacy of the antigens (type and presentation), the likelihood of significant duration of immunity being achievable from the vaccine (6 months) and discusses the relevance of the antigens used to current circulating pathogens in Europe. Four different vaccination-challenge studies were carried out to investigate the duration of immunity provided by Bovalto Respi 4\u00ae against each of the strains included in the vaccine, i.e. Pi3, BRSV, BVD, and Mannheimia haemolytica. The design was similar for each study, apart from the challenge materials themselves and the type of follow-up that was used (adapted to each pathogen). Materials and Methods Vaccine efficacy Efficacy requirements of the immunogenicity test of the corresponding European Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) monographs were applied when existing (or by default, monographs dealing with similar antigen were used). The consent of the Ethics Committee on the use of animals for the trial was obtained. Two-week-old colostrum deprived calves were vaccinated twice at 21-day intervals and challenged 6 months after the 2nd injection. Ten calves were used for the viral studies and divided into two groups, one of 5 vaccinated and one of 5 controls. Sixteen calves were used for Mannheimia haemolytica with groups of 8 each for the vaccinated animals and controls. Animals were observed daily during the 14 days after challenge for the viral strains in order to detect clinical symptoms of respiratory disease such as sneezing, nasal discharge, coughing, etc. A scoring table was used for each of the criteria. Rectal temperature was also recorded daily and temperatures above 40 \u00b0C were considered as hyperthermia. Nasal swabs were systematically performed, starting on the day of challenge and subsequently daily from the 3rd day post-challenge until the end of the study. The follow-up of calves challenged by Mannheimia haemolytica (M. haemolytica) was shorter, lasting just 7 days (as per Ph. Eur. 1944 recommendations for the immunogenicity test). Daily clinical observations for respiratory signs as well as rectal temperature were recorded. A post mortem examination was performed to identify lung lesions caused by M. haemolytica and to re-isolate the bacteria. Indeed, M. haemolytica is commensal in the upper respiratory tract, becoming pathogenic once it has reached the lungs where it causes severe pathology to lung tissue such as fibrinous changes and necrosis. Table 2 below recapitulates details on the challenge materials used in the vaccine efficacy studies (virus details and inoculation approach). Serology was performed on blood samples to determine the level of antibodies for the viral strains using virus neutralisation technique and results were expressed as PD50 (serum dilution protecting 50% of the infected wells). A classical enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to assess the level of M. haemolytica antibodies. Nasal swabs were immediately diluted and inoculated into MDBK cell line suspension on 96-well plates. After incubation for 5 days, Pi3 titre was determined based on its specific cytopathogenic effect whilst immunofluorescence staining was used to reveal and titrate the levels of BVD and BRSV. Results were expressed in TCID50 (50% Tissue Culture Infective Dose). In the course of M. haemolytica challenge, post mortem lungs samples were cultivated in a liquid medium in tubes. The positivity of the samples for M. haemolytica was then assessed. The level of difference between vaccinated and control groups was tested by comparison of two independent selections using the QC Expert 3.1 program and the significance level \u03b1 = 0.05. First, the compliance of variances of both selections was tested by the Fisher-Snedecor test and based on the test results a matching t-test (for the same or different variances) was subsequently used for testing of the compliance of the mean values.",

                    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nPartner notification (PN) is the process whereby sexual partners of an index patient are informed of their exposure to a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and the need to obtain treatment. For the person (index patient) with a curable STI, PN aims to eradicate infection and prevent re-infection. For sexual partners, PN aims to identify and treat undiagnosed STIs. At the level of sexual networks and populations, the aim of PN is to interrupt chains of STI transmission. For people with viral STI, PN aims to identify undiagnosed infections, which can facilitate access for their sexual partners to treatment and help prevent transmission.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo assess the effects of different PN strategies in people with STI, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.\n\n\nSEARCH METHODS\nWe searched electronic databases (the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE) without language restrictions. We scanned reference lists of potential studies and previous reviews and contacted experts in the field. We searched three trial registries. We conducted the most recent search on 31 August 2012.\n\n\nSELECTION CRITERIA\nPublished or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs comparing two or more PN strategies. Four main PN strategies were included: patient referral, expedited partner therapy, provider referral and contract referral. Patient referral means that the patient notifies their sexual partners, either with (enhanced patient referral) or without (simple patient referral) additional verbal or written support. In expedited partner therapy, the patient delivers medication or a prescription for medication to their partner(s) without the need for a medical examination of the partner. In provider referral, health service personnel notify the partners. In contract referral, the index patient is encouraged to notify partner, with the understanding that the partners will be contacted if they do not visit the health service by a certain date.\n\n\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS\nWe analysed data according to paired partner referral strategies. We organised the comparisons first according to four main PN strategies (1. enhanced patient referral, 2. expedited partner therapy, 3. contract referral, 4. provider referral). We compared each main strategy with simple patient referral and then with each other, if trials were available. For continuous outcome measures, we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For dichotomous variables, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. We performed meta-analyses where appropriate. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome re-infection rate of the index patient by excluding studies with attrition of greater than 20%. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information.\n\n\nMAIN RESULTS\nWe included 26 trials (17,578 participants, 9015 women and 8563 men). Five trials were conducted in developing countries. Only two trials were conducted among HIV-positive patients. There was potential for selection bias, owing to the methods of allocation used and of performance bias, owing to the lack of blinding in most included studies. Seven trials had attrition of greater than 20%, increasing the risk of bias.The review found moderate-quality evidence that expedited partner therapy is better than simple patient referral for preventing re-infection of index patients when combining trials of STIs that caused urethritis or cervicitis (6 trials; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.89, I(2) = 39%). When studies with attrition greater than 20% were excluded, the effect of expedited partner therapy was attenuated (2 trials; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.04, I(2) = 0%). In trials restricted to index patients with chlamydia, the effect was attenuated (2 trials; RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.35, I(2) = 22%). Expedited partner therapy also increased the number of partners treated per index patient (three trials) when compared with simple patient referral in people with chlamydia or gonorrhoea (MD 0.43, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.58) or trichomonas (MD 0.51, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.67), and people with any STI syndrome (MD 0.5, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.67). Expedited partner therapy was not superior to enhanced patient referral in preventing re-infection (3 trials; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.53, I(2) = 33%, low-quality evidence). Home sampling kits for partners (four trials) did not result in lower rates of re-infection in the index case (measured in one trial), or higher numbers of partners elicited (three trials), notified (two trials) or treated (one trial) when compared with simple patient referral. There was no consistent evidence for the relative effects of provider, contract or other patient referral methods. In one trial among men with non-gonococcal urethritis, more partners were treated with provider referral than with simple patient referral (MD 0.5, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.63). In one study among people with syphilis, contract referral elicited treatment of more partners than provider referral (MD 2.2, 95% CI 1.95 to 2.45), but the number of partners receiving treatment was the same in both groups. Where measured, there was no statistical evidence of differences in the incidence of adverse effects between PN strategies.\n\n\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS\nThe evidence assessed in this review does not identify a single optimal strategy for PN for any particular STI. When combining trials of STI causing urethritis or cervicitis, expedited partner therapy was more successful than simple patient referral for preventing re-infection of the index patient but was not superior to enhanced patient referral. Expedited partner therapy interventions should include all components that were part of the trial intervention package. There was insufficient evidence to determine the most effective components of an enhanced patient referral strategy. There are too few trials to allow consistent conclusions about the relative effects of provider, contract or other patient referral methods for different STIs. More high-quality RCTs of PN strategies for HIV and syphilis, using biological outcomes, are needed.",

In this paper we study SIR models where heterogeneity is a result of the degree dependence of disease transmission rates. We develop numerical methods to determine the epidemic threshold, the epidemic probability and epidemic size close to the threshold for configuration model contact networks with arbitrary degree distribution and an arbitrary matrix of transmission rates (dependent on transmitting and receiving node degree). For the special case of separable transmission rates we obtain analytical expressions for these quantities. We propose a categorization of spreading processes based on the ratio of the probability of an epidemic and the expected size of an epidemic, and demonstrate that this ratio has a complex dependence on the degree distribution and the degree-dependent transmission rates. For scale-free contact networks and transmission rates that are power functions of transmitting and receiving node degrees, the epidemic threshold may be finite even when the degree distribution powerlaw exponent is below \u03b3 < 3. We give an expression, in terms of the degree distribution and transmission rate exponents, for the limit at which the epidemic threshold vanishes. We find that the expected epidemic size and the probability of an epidemic may grow nonlinearly above the epidemic threshold, with exponents that depend not only on the degree distribution powerlaw exponent, but on the parameters of the transmission rate degree dependence functions, in contrast to ordinary directed percolation and previously studied variations of the SIR model.",

This assumption provides analytical and computational advantages, however, it is often unrealistic when compared to empirical data. Current efforts in modeling nonexponentially distributed infectious periods are either limited to special cases or lead to unsolvable models. Also, the link between empirical data (the infectious period distribution) and the modeling needs (the definition of the corresponding recovery rates) lacks a clear understanding. Here we introduce a mapping of an arbitrary distribution of infectious periods into a distribution of recovery rates. Under the Markovian assumption to ensure analytical tractability, we show that the same infectious period distribution at the population level can be reproduced by two modeling schemes that we call and , depending on the individual response to the infection, and aggregated empirical data cannot easily discriminate the correct scheme. Besides being conceptually different, the two schemes also lead to different epidemic trajectories. Although sharing the same behavior close to the disease-free equilibrium, the scheme deviates from the expected epidemic when reaching the endemic equilibrium of a susceptible-infectious-susceptible transmission model, while the scheme turns out to be equivalent to assuming a homogeneous recovery rate. We show this through analytical computations and stochastic epidemic simulations on a contact network, using both generative network models and empirical contact data. It is therefore possible to reproduce heterogeneous infectious periods in network-based transmission models, however, the resulting prevalence is sensitive to the modeling choice for the interpretation of the empirically collected data on the length of the infectious period. In the absence of higher resolution data, studies should acknowledge such deviations in the epidemic predictions.\n \n \n \n \n Published by the American Physical Society\n 2024\n \n \n",

However, the resulting models are high-dimensional and their analysis is often out of reach. It turns out that mean-field models, low-dimensional systems of differential equations, whose variables are carefully chosen expected quantities from the exact model provide a good approximation and incorporate explicitly some network properties. Despite the emergence of such mean-field models, there has been limited work on investigating whether these can be used for inference purposes. In this paper, we consider network-based mean-field models and explore the problem of parameter identifiability when observations about an epidemic are available. Making use of the analytical tractability of most network-based mean-field models, e.g. explicit analytical expressions for leading eigenvalue and final epidemic size, we set up the parameter identifiability problem as finding the solution or solutions of a system of coupled equations. More precisely, subject to observing/measuring growth rate and final epidemic size, we seek to identify parameter values leading to these measurements. We are particularly concerned with disentangling transmission rate from the network density. To do this, we give a condition for practical identifiability and we find that except for the simplest model, parameters cannot be uniquely determined, that is, they are practically unidentifiable. This means that there exist multiple solutions (a manifold of infinite measure) which give rise to model output that is close to the data. Identifying, formalising and analytically describing this problem should lead to a better appreciation of the complexity involved in fitting models with many parameters to data.",

By performing phylogeographic analysis of MPXV genomes sampled from 757 individuals in NYC between April 2022 and April 2023, and 3,287 MPXV genomes sampled around the world, we identify over 200 introductions of MPXV into NYC with at least 84 leading to onward transmission. These infections primarily occurred among men who have sex with men, transgender women and nonbinary individuals. Through a comparative analysis with HIV in NYC, we find that both MPXV and HIV genomic cluster sizes are best fit by scale-free distributions, and that people in MPXV clusters are more likely to have previously received an HIV diagnosis and be a member of a recently growing HIV transmission cluster. We model MPXV transmission through sexual contact networks and show that highly connected individuals would be disproportionately infected at the start of an epidemic, which would likely result in the exhaustion of the most densely connected parts of the network, and, therefore, explain the rapid expansion and decline of the NYC outbreak. By coupling the genomic epidemiology of MPXV and HIV with epidemic modeling, we demonstrate that the transmission dynamics of MPXV in NYC can be understood by general principles of sexually transmitted pathogens.",

To this end, we propose a local and global information controlled spreading model to explore the dynamics of two spreading processes. In the upper layer, we construct a threshold model to describe the awareness diffusion process and introduce local and global awareness information as variables into an individual awareness ratio. In the lower layer, we adopt the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible model to represent the epidemic propagation process and introduce local and global epidemic information into individual precaution degree to reflect individual heterogeneity.
