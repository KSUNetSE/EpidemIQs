                    "abstract": "The summary measurement of an epidemic such as the final size is an important quantity that allows us to approximate the impact of the disease on the affected region. In recent years, final size measurements for vector-transmitted diseases have acquired importance because of the increased concern for mosquito-borne diseases like dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, etc. However, analytical expressions for this estimate in the stage-structured models applicable to vector-borne diseases are less, mostly focused on the classical Kermack\u2013McKendrick model. In this paper, we first calculate the final size expressions for an SIR model with carrier state and a SEIR\u2013SI host\u2013vector model. Then we extend this for the SEIR\u2013SI host\u2013vector model with treatment class in the host, as well as for the model with vertical transmission in the vector population. Finally, we verify our final size expression with some real scenarios.",

Their inducing epidemics last longer, have a higher number of asymptomatic cases, and are more serious. In this article, we proposed a nonautonomous time-delayed susceptible-infected-removed (NATD-SIR) model to predict them in different regions of China. We obtained the maximum and its time of current infected persons, the final size, and the end time of COVID-19 epidemics from January 2022 in China. The method of the fifth-order moving average was used to preprocess the time series of the numbers of current infected and removed cases to obtain more accurate parameter estimations. We found that usually the transmission rate $ \\beta(t) $ was a piecewise exponential decay function, but due to multiple bounces in Shanghai City, $ \\beta(t) $ was approximately a piecewise quadratic function. In most regions, the removed rate $ \\gamma(t) $ was approximately equal to a piecewise linear increasing function of (a*t+b)*H(t-k), but in a few areas, $ \\gamma(t) $ displayed an exponential increasing trend. For cases where the removed rate cannot be obtained, we proposed a method for setting the removed rate, which has a good approximation. Using the numerical solution, we obtained the prediction results of the epidemics. By analyzing those important indicators of COVID-19, we provided valuable suggestions for epidemic prevention and control and the resumption of work and production.",

                    "abstract": "Background Facing a global epidemic of new infectious diseases such as COVID-19, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), which reduce transmission rates without medical actions, are being implemented around the world to mitigate spreads. One of the problems in assessing the effects of NPIs is that different NPIs have been implemented at different times based on the situation of each country; therefore, few assumptions can be shared about how the introduction of policies affects the patient population. Mathematical models can contribute to further understanding these phenomena by obtaining analytical solutions as well as numerical simulations. Methods and results In this study, an NPI was introduced into the SIR model for a conceptual study of infectious diseases under the condition that the transmission rate was reduced to a fixed value only once within a finite time duration, and its effect was analyzed numerically and theoretically. It was analytically shown that the maximum fraction of infected individuals and the final size could be larger if the intervention starts too early. The analytical results also suggested that more individuals may be infected at the peak of the second wave with a stronger intervention. Conclusions This study provides quantitative relationship between the strength of a one-shot intervention and the reduction in the number of patients with no approximation. This suggests the importance of the strength and time of NPIs, although detailed studies are necessary for the implementation of NPIs in complicated real-world environments as the model used in this study is based on various simplifications.",

                    "abstract": "Simple Summary Predicting the spreading trend of the COVID-19 epidemic is one of the hot topics in the modeling field. In this study, we applied a continuous Markov-chain model to simulate the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. The results of this study indicate that the herd immunity threshold should be significantly higher than 1 \u2212 1/R0. Taking the immunity waning effect into consideration, the model could predict an epidemic resurgence after the herd immunity threshold. Meanwhile, this Markov-chain approach could also forecast the epidemic distribution and predict the epidemic hotspots at different times. It is implied from our model that it is significantly challenging to eradicate SARS-CoV-2 in the short term. The actual epidemic development is consistent with our prediction. In the end, this method displayed great potential as an alternative approach to traditional compartment models. Abstract To address the urgent need to accurately predict the spreading trend of the COVID-19 epidemic, a continuous Markov-chain model was, for the first time, developed in this work to predict the spread of COVID-19 infection. A probability matrix of infection was first developed in this model based upon the contact frequency of individuals within the population, the individual\u2019s characteristics, and other factors that can effectively reflect the epidemic\u2019s temporal and spatial variation characteristics. The Markov-chain model was then extended to incorporate both the mutation effect of COVID-19 and the decaying effect of antibodies. The developed comprehensive Markov-chain model that integrates the aforementioned factors was finally tested by real data to predict the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic. The result shows that our model can effectively avoid the prediction dilemma that may exist with traditional ordinary differential equations model, such as the susceptible\u2013infectious\u2013recovered (SIR) model. Meanwhile, it can forecast the epidemic distribution and predict the epidemic hotspots geographically at different times. It is also demonstrated in our result that the influence of the population\u2019s spatial and geographic distribution in a herd infection event is needed in the model for a better prediction of the epidemic trend. At the same time, our result indicates that no simple derivative relationship exists between the threshold of herd immunity and the virus basic reproduction number R0. The threshold of herd immunity achieved through natural immunity is significantly higher than 1 \u2212 1/R0. These not only explain the theoretical misconceptions of herd immunity thresholds in herd immunity theory but also provide a guidance for predicting the optimal vaccination coverage. In addition, our model can predict the temporal and spatial distribution of infections in different epidemic waves. It is implied from our model that it is challenging to eradicate COVID-19 in the short term for a large population size and a wide spatial distribution. It is predicted that COVID-19 is likely to coexist with humans for a long time and that it will exhibit multipoint epidemic effects at a later stage. The statistical evidence is consistent with our prediction and strongly supports our modeling results.",

All possible pathways of the interaction between cationic species [Cp2ZrMe+] and counteranions, [A\u2212] = [MeB(C6F5)3]\u2212 and [B(C6F5)4]\u2212, were examined during chain initiation, propagation, and termination steps. The calculations reveal an active chain-end mechanism with O-alkyl bond cleavage of the polymerisation. The catalytic performance of the two counteranions is found to be identical, and they influence the initial process through stabilisation of the cationic species via non-covalent interactions (NCI), with the [MeB(C6F5)3]\u2212 anion stabilising the catalyst\u2013monomer complex more effectively than the [B(C6F5)4]\u2212 anion by 24.3 kJ mol\u22121. The first two propagations are likely the rate-determining step, with calculated free-energy barriers of 61.4\u201371.2 and 73.9\u201380.6 kJ mol\u22121 with and without the anions (A\u2212), respectively. The presence of the counteranion significantly affects the third propagation rate, lowering the barriers up to 20 kJ mol\u22121. Comparison of the first termination and the third propagation shows that they are not competitive, with the termination being less facile. We also studied the initiation and propagation steps for the hafnocene catalyst and found that the Hf catalyst slightly favours the CL CROP in comparison to the Zr catalyst. Analysis of solvent and dispersion interaction demonstrates that both factors play an important role in the process. NCI analysis reveals weak (van der Waals) interactions at the contacts between the cationic species and the counteranions during the reaction course.

The molecular structures of Fe2 and Fe3 were determined by X-ray diffraction, revealing a pseudo-square-pyramidal geometry. High activities were achieved toward ethylene polymerization in each iron complex case. The sterically least demanding ligand enhanced the activity of its complex Fe1 with the highest activity up to 16.8 \u00d7 106 g of PE (mol of Fe)-1 h-1at 70 \u00b0C, while the bulkiest ligand led to the formation of the highest molecular weight of the resulting polyethylene using Fe6. Generally, the resulting polyethylenes are highly linear and most of them have a tendency to display bimodal distributions by virtue of the presence of multiple sites or competing chain transfer reactions.

A\u03b240 and A\u03b242, as two most prominent isoforms of A\u03b2 peptides, can cross-interact with each other and form co-aggregates, which affect the progression of the disease. However, the molecular determinants underlying A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 cross-interaction and the structural details of their co-oligomers remain elusive. Herein, we performed all-atom explicit-solvent replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations on A\u03b240-A\u03b242 heterogeneous and A\u03b240/A\u03b242 homogeneous dimer systems to dissect the co-aggregation mechanisms of the two isoforms. Our results show that the interpeptide main-chain interaction of A\u03b240-A\u03b242 is stronger than that of A\u03b240-A\u03b240 and A\u03b242-A\u03b242. The positions of hotspot residues in heterodimers and homodimers display high similarity, implying similar molecular recognition sites for both cross-interaction and self-interaction. Contact maps of A\u03b240-A\u03b242 heterodimers reveal that residue pairs crucial for cross-interaction are mostly located in the C-terminal hydrophobic regions of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 peptides. Conformational analysis shows that A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 monomers can co-assemble into \u03b2-sheet-rich heterodimers with shorter \u03b2-sheets than those in homodimers, which is decremental to monomer addition. Similar molecular recognition sites and \u03b2-sheet distribution of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 peptides are observed in heterodimers and homodimers, which may provide the molecular basis for the two isoforms' co-aggregation and cross-seeding. Our work dissects the co-aggregation mechanisms of A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 peptides at the atomic level, which will help for in-depth understanding of the cross-talk between the two A\u03b2 isoforms and the pathogenesis of AD.",

In this mini-review, the recent discovery of two unprecedented chain termination processes is summarized: chain transfer to solvent (CTS) and chain transfer to monomer (CTM), leading to benzyl/tolyl and allyl type chain ends, respectively. Although similar transfer reactions are well-known in radical polymerization, only very recently they have been observed also in olefin insertion polymerization catalysis. In the latter context, these processes were first identified in Ti-catalyzed propene and ethene polymerization; more recently, CTS was also reported in Sc-catalyzed styrene polymerization. In the Ti case, these processes represent a unique combination of insertion polymerization, organic radical chemistry and reactivity of a M(IV)/M(III) redox couple. In the Sc case, CTS occurs via a \u03c3-bond metathesis reactivity, and it is associated with a significant boost of catalytic activity and/or with tuning of polystyrene molecular weight and tacticity. The mechanistic studies that led to the understanding of these chain transfer reactions are summarized, highlighting their relevance in olefin polymerization catalysis and beyond.",

Indirect effects arise when vaccinated individuals block disease transmission in any infection chain they are part of, and this in turn can benefit both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Indirect effects are difficult to quantify in practice but, in this article, working with the susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered (SIR) model, they are analytically calculated in important cases, through pivoting on the final size formula for epidemics. Their relationship to herd immunity is also clarified. The analysis allows us to identify the important distinction between quantifying the indirect effects of vaccination at the \u2018population level\u2019 versus the \u2018per capita\u2019 level, which often results in radically different conclusions. As an example, our analysis unpacks why the population-level indirect effect can appear significantly larger than its per capita analogue. In addition, we consider a recently proposed epidemiological non-pharmaceutical intervention (by the means of recovered individuals) used over the COVID-19 pandemic, referred to as \u2018shielding\u2019, and study its impact on our mathematical analysis. The shielding scheme is extended to take advantage of vaccination including imperfect vaccination.",

It is well known that treatment can have a specific effect on the spread of epidemics, and due to the limited resources of treatment, the number of patients during severe disease outbreaks who need to be treated may exceed the treatment capacity. Consequently, the number of patients who receive treatment will reach a saturation level. Thus, we incorporated a saturated treatment function into the model to characterize such a phenomenon. The dynamics of the present model is discussed in this paper. We first obtained a threshold value R0, which determines the stability of a disease-free equilibrium. Furthermore, we investigated the bifurcation behavior at R0=1. More specifically, we derived a condition that determines the direction of bifurcation at R0=1. If the direction is backward, then a stable disease-free equilibrium concurrently exists with a stable endemic equilibrium even though R0<1. Therefore, in this case, R0<1 is not sufficient to eradicate the disease from the population. However, if the direction is forward, we find that for a range of parameters, multiple equilibria could exist to the left and right of R0=1. In this case, the initial infectious invasion must be controlled to a lower level so that the disease dies out or approaches a lower endemic steady state.",

                    "abstract": "Aim/Purpose: The understanding of disease spread dynamics in the context of air travel is crucial for effective disease detection and epidemic intelligence. The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Hospitalized-Critical-Deaths (SEIR-HCD) model proposed in this research work is identified as a valuable tool for capturing the complex dynamics of disease transmission, healthcare demands, and mortality rates during epidemics.\n\nBackground: The spread of viral diseases is a major problem for public health services all over the world. Understanding how diseases spread is important in order to take the right steps to stop them. In epidemiology, the SIS, SIR, and SEIR models have been used to mimic and study how diseases spread in groups of people.\n\nMethodology: This research focuses on the integration of air traffic network data into the SEIR-HCD model to enhance the understanding of disease spread in air travel settings. By incorporating air traffic data, the model considers the role of travel patterns and connectivity in disease dissemination, enabling the identification of high-risk routes, airports, and regions.\n\nContribution: This research contributes to the field of epidemiology by enhancing our understanding of disease spread dynamics through the application of the SIS, SIR, and SEIR-HCD models. The findings provide insights into the factors influencing disease transmission, allowing for the development of effective strategies for disease control and prevention.\n\nFindings: The interplay between local outbreaks and global disease dissemination through air travel is empirically explored. The model can be further used for the evaluation of the effectiveness of surveillance and early detection measures at airports and transportation hubs. The proposed research contributes to proactive and evidence-based strategies for disease prevention and control, offering insights into the impact of air travel on disease transmission and supporting public health interventions in air traffic networks.\n\nRecommendations for Practitioners: Government intervention can be studied during difficult times which plays as a moderating variable that can enhance or hinder the efficacy of epidemic intelligence efforts within air traffic networks. Expert collaboration from various fields, including epidemiology, aviation, data science, and public health with an interdisciplinary approach can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the disease spread dynamics in air traffic networks. \n\nRecommendation for Researchers: Researchers can collaborate with international health organizations and authorities to share their research findings and contribute to a global understanding of disease spread in air traffic networks.\n\nImpact on Society: This research has significant implications for society. By providing a deeper understanding of disease spread dynamics, it enables policymakers, public health officials, and practitioners to make informed decisions to mitigate disease outbreaks. The recommendations derived from this research can aid in the development of effective strategies to control and prevent the spread of infectious diseases, ultimately leading to improved public health outcomes and reduced societal disruptions.\n\nFuture Research: Practitioners of the research can contribute more effectively to disease outbreaks within the context of air traffic networks, ultimately helping to protect public health and global travel. By considering air traffic patterns, the SEIR-HCD model contributes to more accurate modeling and prediction of disease outbreaks, aiding in the development of proactive and evidence-based strategies to manage and mitigate the impact of infectious diseases in the context of air travel.\n\n",

The IoT uses smart objects which are embedded into the environment and interact by transmitting several messages which interference with other messages on receiving nodes. This can lead to inevitable sensors\u2019 (nodes\u2019) deterioration after transmitting a considerable number of messages. Interference mitigation In a complex network such as the IoT is still a subject of active research which could benefit many real-world applications. Collection trees algorithms and protocols can be used adopted to reduce the interference on the nodes/paths of an IoT network but but can not fully stop or avoid interference across an IoT network. Building upon a mapping between path interference on devices (nodes) and real life contamination of a disease that can move an individual from a susceptible (S) to infected (I) and replaced (R) statuses, this paper revisits the collection tree algorithms with the objective of studying the dynamics of the interference in IoT networks. In this study, the IoT network\u2019s nodes are partitioned into mutually exclusive groups based on possible epidemic spread. For each group, an SIR model is proposed in a form of a system of difference equations. The model is analysed by studying the system stability and simulations are used to study the real time status of the interference across the network.",

We show that the diffusion is not described by the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, but rather by a new model, the Bass-SIR model, which combines the Bass model for diffusion of new products with the SIR model for epidemics. The phase transition of consumers from nonadopters to adopters is described by a nonstandard Kolmogorov-Johnson-Mehl-Avrami model, in which clusters growth is limited by adopters' recovery. Therefore, diffusion in the Bass-SIR model only depends on the local structure of the social network, but not on the average distance between consumers. Consequently, unlike the SIR model, a small-worlds structure has a negligible effect on the diffusion. Moreover, unlike the SIR model, there is no threshold value above which the diffusion will peter out. Surprisingly, diffusion on scale-free networks is nearly identical to that on Cartesian ones.",

In recent years, the research community has acquired strong evidences of complex and heterogeneous connections and diverse patterns in a variety of real human contact networks. The heterogeneity of network topologies has a deep influence on understanding the spreading dynamics of disease. In the process of infection spread, network edges are the critical communication channels. Many existing approaches for identifying prominent nodes in such networks rely on node attributes. Further, in unweighted networks, all the edges are considered to be equal, which imposes an unrealistic assumption for epidemic spreading through frequent interactions between humans. Here, we present an edge weighting technique, named as, Weighted Hybrid Centrality $\\left( {{W_{{C_H}}}} \\right)$, that takes into account multiple centrality indicators, including degree, k-shell, and eigenvector centrality, as well as the frequency of interactions be-tween any two users (nodes) which is considered as potential edge weight. To analyze the performance of ${W_{{C_H}}}$, we have utilized the weighted susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered (W-SIR) simulator and have carried out a comparative experiment on six real-world heterogeneous networks. The proposed technique outperforms the baseline methods with 0.067 to 0.641 averaged Kendall\u2019s \u03c4 score. This method is useful for modeling disease dynamics and identifying highly influential contacts by considering both node and edge properties.",

For the sake of dealing with this problem, there are three models being developed. Firstly, this paper establishes the model 1 on the basis of the classical model of SIR and diffusion characteristic of Ebola virus. It verifies the reduction of the spread of the virus, the improvement of the patient\u2019s cure rate and the effectiveness of three preventive measures which are significant in the formation of herd immunity. At the same time, we use linear programming to control the cost of drug delivery. Model 2, namely, the model of SIR with pulse vaccination, provides a pulse vaccination therapy on the basis of model 1. Model 2 considers many factors comprehensively, such as the cycle of inoculation, vaccination rate, the birth rate, death rate and so on. We use differential equation models to get the critical condition of the number of susceptible people, vaccination rate, and the development of predicated estimate with the change of time. Next, based on the model 2, we establish model 3 which not only considers many factors comprehensively, such as the amount of supply, the location of supply and so on, but also introduce 0-1 variable to combine the general linear programming with another linear programming which is not fixed but multi objectives so that we get the drug delivery network. Meanwhile, this paper obtains the best drug delivery program which has to spend the minimum cost on the condition of effectively controlling the epidemic. Also the result can alleviate serious situation of the Ebola virus epidemic diffusion through the drug delivery network. This paper puts forward the improvement of the model by using the Self-Organizing Map neural network and cluster analysis to get the urgent degree of different epidemic areas and divide these areas into different priorities. We get a goal programming model based on different priority. Furthermore, we use the drug delivery model and Lingo to get a more reliable drug delivery program on the basis of the objective function of priority.",
