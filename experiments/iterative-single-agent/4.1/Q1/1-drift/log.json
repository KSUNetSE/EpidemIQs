Each section will detail the models, formulas, simulation results (metrics extracted, e.g. peak, final size), and a thorough discussion/interpretation of the effect of degree heterogeneity on SEIR epidemic outcomes relative to homogeneous mixing. The results section will leverage the generated plots and all simulation metrics. The next output will be the complete LaTeX manuscript.",
