We systematically construct a network of $N=1000$ nodes (mean degree $\\langle k\\rangle\\sim8$) and parameterize the SIR model to reflect COVID-19's basic reproduction number $(R_0=3.0)$ and recovery rate $\\gamma=1/14$~days$^{-1}$. We derive the infection rate $\\beta$ for our network using established theory incorporating degree distribution moments. Stochastic simulations yield time-series of compartmental populations, from which we extract metrics like epidemic size, peak infection, and outbreak duration. Our results confirm significant differences between well-mixed and network-based modeling; the network structure limits the epidemic's final size and shapes the infection curve, in line with epidemic theory. The findings illustrate the importance of incorporating network topology for accurate prediction and intervention planning.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the use of diverse mechanistic models to forecast infectious disease trajectories. Traditional compartmental models such as SIR often assume homogeneous mixing; yet, real-world contacts are highly structured, suggesting that the underlying contact network can profoundly impact epidemic outcomes \\cite{Johnson2024}. Recent studies have shown that network structure---especially in static topologies such as Erd\\'os--R\\'enyi (ER) or scale-free graphs---can alter key metrics like the final epidemic size, peak load on health-care systems, and duration of outbreaks \\cite{Kuryliak2021,Leung2020,BlancoRodriguez2024}. This paper presents a comprehensive simulation study of COVID-19-like dynamics using a parameterized SIR model on an ER network, with all model choices and parameters driven by recent literature.\n\nOur central objective is to quantify how the static contact network, as opposed to random mixing, shapes COVID-19 epidemic dynamics, and to benchmark key metrics---including peak infection fraction, timing, and final size---as well as to outline methodological best practices for such simulations.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\textbf{Network Construction:} We generated a static ER contact network ($N=1000$) with mean degree $\\langle k\\rangle=7.83$, reflecting plausible close-contact patterns for a moderately sized community. The degree distribution and structural features were verified by analyzing the mean and second moment of the degrees ($\\langle k^2\\rangle=69.398$), as recommended by epidemic theory \\cite{Johnson2024}. Figure~\\ref{fig:degree-dist} displays the empirically computed degree distribution.\n\n\\textbf{Model Design:} We implemented the SIR epidemic process, dividing the population into Susceptible ($S$), Infected ($I$), and Recovered ($R$) compartments. Transitions are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $S{\\xrightarrow{\\beta,I}}I$: Susceptible nodes become infected following exposure to infected neighbors, at per-edge rate $\\beta$.\n    \\item $I\\xrightarrow{\\gamma}R$: Infected nodes recover at a per-capita rate $\\gamma$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\textbf{Parameterization:} The network-adjusted infection rate was derived as $\\beta = R_0 \\gamma/q$, where $q = (\\langle k^2\\rangle-\\langle k\\rangle)/\\langle k\\rangle$ is the mean excess degree, yielding $\\beta \\approx0.0273$ for $R_0=3.0$ and $\\gamma=1/14\\text{~days}^{-1}$. Initial conditions were set at 1\\% infected ($I_0=10$), 99\\% susceptible, 0\\% recovered, reflecting the early phase of epidemic expansion. The code for all modeling and simulation steps is provided in the supplement.\n\n\\section{Results}\nThe simulated epidemic trajectory is shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:epidemic-curve}. The fraction of the population infected peaked at $23.7\\%$ of $N$ at $t=43.7$ days. The cumulative epidemic size was $82.7\\%$, indicating that network constraints reduce the ultimate reach of infection compared to the well-mixed SIR---which would typically approach $>90\\%$ for similar $R_0$.\n\nPeak infection occurs rapidly and declines as herd immunity is approached. The simulation's end (when $I<1$) occurred by day 174.4. Table~\\ref{tab:metrics} summarizes key epidemic outcome metrics.\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.7\\linewidth]{degree_distribution.png}\n    \\caption{Degree distribution of the Erd\\'os--R\\'enyi contact network ($N=1000,\\langle k\\rangle=7.83$) used for simulation.}\n    \\label{fig:degree-dist}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.7\\linewidth]{SIR_timeseries_analysis.png}\n    \\caption{SIR compartment evolution over time.

Our peak infection rate and final epidemic size are consistently lower than well-mixed SIR predictions for $R_0=3$ \\cite{Leung2020,Johnson2024}. These findings are consistent with prior work emphasizing the importance of incorporating real-world contact networks into epidemic forecasting and public health planning \\cite{Kuryliak2021,BlancoRodriguez2024}. \n\nStatic ER networks---while stylized---provide a reasonable baseline for communities with homogeneous, randomly assigned contacts. The second moment of the degree distribution is critical for accurate parameterization; neglecting this would have overestimated both outbreak size and peak load on health-care. As found in literature, scale-free or highly heterogeneous networks would likely exhibit even less predictable epidemic characteristics, further reinforcing the need for network-aware modeling \\cite{Johnson2024}.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nWe performed a detailed simulation study of the COVID-19 pandemic's early dynamics using an SIR model on an Erd\\'os--R\\'enyi contact network. We demonstrate that explicit consideration of network structure meaningfully changes epidemic outcomes compared to well-mixed models. Further, our parameterization strategy allows direct mapping from classical epidemiological $R_0$ to network-based transmission rates using degree moments. These results underscore the need for policy and intervention modeling to account for population contact networks.\n\n\\section*{References}\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{}\n\n\\bibitem{Johnson2024} Samuel Johnson.
