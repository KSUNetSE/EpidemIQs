Analytical derivations for epidemic thresholds and reproduction numbers ($R_0$) are presented for both Erdős–Rényi (ER, homogeneous) and Barabási–Albert (BA, heterogeneous) networks. Stochastic simulations of SEIR dynamics are performed on these networks under identical parameterizations and initial conditions. Simulation outcomes are compared to deterministic SEIR ordinary differential equation (ODE) models. Results demonstrate that degree heterogeneity significantly alters epidemic threshold, outbreak speed, and final size. We detail the sources of these differences, discuss implications for predicting real-world epidemics, and evaluate when classical mean-field predictions can or cannot be trusted.  \n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nMathematical modeling of infectious diseases traditionally relies on the assumption of homogeneous (mean-field) mixing, whereby each individual is equally likely to contact any other. Under this approximation, deterministic compartmental models like SEIR provide closed-form results for epidemic threshold and final size. However, real-world contact patterns are invariably heterogeneous: in many contexts, interaction networks are scale-free or heavy-tailed, with a minority of individuals (hubs) responsible for a disproportionate share of contacts. It is well established in the SIR case that such heterogeneity can profoundly affect epidemic thresholds and final outbreak size. The impact of network structure on SEIR dynamics is less explored but is particularly critical for diseases where presymptomatic (exposed, $E$) transmission is important.\n\nRecent research confirms that epidemic outcomes such as peak incidence, total epidemic size, and extinction probability differ measurably between homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, especially as the variance of degree distribution increases\\cite{bmcmed,Ross2010,PastorSatorrasRevModPhys2015,natcomms,applnetsci2024}. Moreover, the value and predictive power of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ changes when moving from mean-field models to configuration-type networks\\cite{bmcmed,Ross2010}. Yet, detailed quantitative comparison for the SEIR model - involving both analytical thresholds and stochastic simulation on realistic network topologies - is less frequently reported. This study directly addresses this gap by (1) deriving analytical expressions for threshold and reproduction number for both ER and BA networks; (2) simulating SEIR epidemics on these networks under controlled, comparable conditions; and (3) extracting and interpreting the key epidemic metrics in each scenario.  \n\\section{Methodology}\n\n\\subsection{Scenario and Scientific Goal}\nWe study the effect of network heterogeneity on SEIR epidemic dynamics, using two network types: (i) Erdős–Rényi (ER), representing homogeneous random mixing, and (ii) Barabási–Albert (BA), representing scale-free, heavy-tailed degree distributions. All networks are static and undirected. We analytically and numerically compare epidemic size, peak, duration, and speed between these cases for an otherwise identical SEIR process. The mechanistic SEIR model is defined by compartments: $S$ (susceptible), $E$ (exposed), $I$ (infectious), $R$ (removed), with transitions:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $S \\xrightarrow{\\beta,I} E$: Infections induced by infectious contacts at rate $\\beta$\n    \\item $E \\xrightarrow{\\sigma} I$: Exposed become infectious at rate $\\sigma$\n    \\item $I \\xrightarrow{\\gamma} R$: Infectious recover at rate $\\gamma$\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\subsection{Network Construction and Parameters}\n\nTwo networks of $N = 1000$ nodes, mean degree $\\langle k \\rangle \\approx 8$, were created:\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item ER: Erdős–Rényi $G(N, p)$, $p = 8/(N-1)$\n  \\item BA: Barabási–Albert, $m = 4$\n\\end{itemize}\nSummary statistics:\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item ER: $\\langle k \\rangle=8.036$, $\\langle k^2 \\rangle=72.48$\n  \\item BA: $\\langle k \\rangle=7.97$, $\\langle k^2 \\rangle=138.02$\n\\end{itemize}\nSee Figure~\\ref{fig:degree-dist} for degree distributions.\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{degree_distributions.png}\n    \\caption{Degree distribution for ER (homogeneous) and BA (heterogeneous) networks.}\n    \\label{fig:degree-dist}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{SEIR Model Details and Analytical Thresholds}\n\nParameter values:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Transmission rate: $\\beta=0.07$\n    \\item Progression (latent): $\\sigma=0.2$ (latent period $5$)\n    \\item Recovery rate: $\\gamma=0.2$ (infectious period $5$)\n\\end{itemize}\nInitial conditions: $S=99\\%$, $E=0\\%$, $I=1\\%$, $R=0\\%$ (initialized randomly).\nSimulation time window: $0-200$ units. Number of stochastic runs: $10$ per network.\n\nFor network-based SEIR, the effective contact factor $q = (\\langle k^2 \\rangle - \\langle k \\rangle)/\\langle k \\rangle$. The analytical reproduction number on a network is:\n\\begin{align*}\n  R_0 &= \\frac{\\beta\\,q}{\\gamma} \\\\\n  R_0^{ER} &\\approx 2.81\\\\\n  R_0^{BA} &\\approx 5.71\n\\end{align*}\nThe deterministic ODE mean-field model uses the same rates and $k_{mean}$ as the ER network. See Figure~\\ref{fig:ode}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.6\\textwidth]{seir_ode_reference.png}\n    \\caption{Deterministic ODE solution for SEIR with homogeneous-mixing.}\n    \\label{fig:ode}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Simulation Workflow}\nNetworks, model, and simulation were implemented in Python (see code in Appendix). The FastGEMF package was used for efficient SEIR simulation on networks. Simulation output was analyzed for peak $I$, epidemic duration, final size, and exponential growth rates.\n\n\\section{Results}\nThe epidemic curves for $I(t)$ on both ER and BA networks are presented in Figure~\\ref{fig:I-comp}. Key quantitative metrics (mean over 10 runs):\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{ER network}: Peak $I=99$, at $t=38.3$; Final size $R=827$, Epidemic duration $=96.8$ units\n    \\item \\textbf{BA network}: Peak $I=131$, at $t=37.0$; Final size $R=786$, Epidemic duration $=89.0$ units\n    \\item Doubling time (early phase): ER $4.08$, BA $19.59$\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.7\\textwidth]{I_curve_comparison.png}\n    \\caption{Comparison of infectious ($I$) population over time for SEIR on ER (homogeneous) and BA (heterogeneous) networks.}\n    \\label{fig:I-comp}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Curve Shape Comparison}\nThe BA (heterogeneous) network produces a higher and earlier peak in $I$, but a shorter overall epidemic and smaller final size. The initial epidemic takes off much faster in the BA case (steeper early slope), yet also exhausts susceptibles more quickly due to clustering around hubs. The ER curve is more symmetric, more gradual, and leads to higher total attack rate. Early exponential growth rates, and timing of major transitions, also differ substantially (see above doubling times).\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\\subsection{Analytical Insights}\nAnalytical threshold calculations show that increased degree variance in the BA network strongly enhances $q$ and thus $R_0$, compared to the ER network, even when mean degree is matched. This means that classical mean-field $R_0$ can greatly underestimate epidemic risk in heterogeneous populations. When network structure is incorporated, the risk of explosive epidemics increases with degree variance, as confirmed in simulation and theory\\cite{bmcmed,PastorSatorrasRevModPhys2015}.\n\n\\subsection{Simulation and Realism}\nStochastic simulation results corroborate analytical predictions: the epidemic on the BA network starts earlier and peaks higher, but also depletes the susceptible pool among highly connected nodes faster, leading to earlier ending and a slightly smaller final epidemic size. This aligns with known properties of epidemics in scale-free networks\\cite{natcomms,applnetsci2024}. More symmetrical epidemic curves, smaller peaks, and longer durations are characteristic of more homogeneous ER-type networks. The ODE-SEIR and ER-network results align closely, confirming that mean-field approximations are reliable in homogeneous networks but not for strongly heterogeneous contact populations.\n\nDegree-heterogeneous networks—common in real-world human contacts—thus modify both prediction and control of epidemic outbreaks. Control strategies and $R_0$ estimation must account for contact heterogeneity. Importantly, these results justify agent-based or network models over mean-field compartmental models for settings with highly skewed degree distributions.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nIncorporation of degree-heterogeneous network structure in SEIR models changes fundamental disease dynamics. Compared to homogeneous-mixing (ER) assumptions, scale-free (BA) networks show:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Higher $R_0$ for same mean degree\n    \\item Larger, earlier epidemic peaks and faster initial growth\n    \\item Shorter epidemic duration but smaller final epidemic size\n\\end{itemize}\nDeterministic ODE models can closely approximate ER network results but systematically mischaracterize dynamics on degree-heterogeneous networks. Our findings reinforce the need for network-based or agent-based modeling and control in epidemiology, especially for pathogens with presymptomatic transmission.\n\n\\section{References}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{}\n\n\\bibitem{bmcmed}\nC.
