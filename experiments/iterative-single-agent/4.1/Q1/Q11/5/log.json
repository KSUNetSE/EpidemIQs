We investigate and contrast the behavior of the SEIR model on degree-homogeneous (Erdős–Rényi, ER) and degree-heterogeneous (Barabási–Albert, BA) static networks, using both deterministic mean-field (homogeneous-mixing) differential equations and stochastic network-based simulations. Our results, grounded in matched parameters (mean degree and $R_0$), reveal that degree heterogeneity produces markedly different epidemic characteristics, with lower peak prevalence, extended epidemic duration, and reduced final epidemic size in heterogeneous networks compared to homogeneous-mixing. These findings are substantiated by analytical expressions and stochastic simulations, bridging classical epidemiological theory and the realities of contact network variability.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\nUnderstanding how contact structure affects the spread of infectious diseases is a cornerstone of mathematical epidemiology. Classic compartmental models (e.g., SEIR) often assume homogeneous mixing, equating to a random regular or Erdős–Rényi (ER) network in which all individuals have roughly equal contact numbers\\cite{Read2008, PMC2394553}. Real-world social networks, however, display degree heterogeneity and clustering, better represented by models such as the Barabási–Albert (BA) network\\cite{Barabasi1999, Endo2021}. Degree heterogeneity is known to affect epidemic thresholds, peak size, and final size, but the quantitative differences, especially in the SEIR context, require rigorous exploration. We conduct a comparative study using deterministic and stochastic modeling to elucidate these effects and help inform the design of better public health interventions.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\\subsection{Epidemic Model}\nWe employ the SEIR framework, with compartments for Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infectious (I), and Removed (R) individuals. Transition rates are defined as follows: exposure upon contact with an infectious neighbor ($\\beta$); progression to infectious ($\\sigma$); and removal (recovery) ($\\gamma$). Parameters were selected to reflect a generic respiratory disease: latent period $1/\\sigma = 3$ days, infectious period $1/\\gamma = 5$ days, and a target mean-field $R_0$ of approximately 2.5.\n\n\\subsection{Network Construction}\nTwo types of static networks were constructed for a population of $N=1000$ with a matched mean degree ($\\langle k \\rangle \\approx 12$):\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Erdős–Rényi (ER)}: $G(n,p)$ random graph, modeling homogeneous-mixing.\n    \\item \\textbf{Barabási–Albert (BA)}: Preferential attachment, modeling degree heterogeneity typical of social networks.\n\\end{itemize}\nDegree distributions were confirmed by plotting (see Figure~\\ref{fig:degree-dist}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{degree-dist.png}\n  \\caption{Degree distributions of ER (homogeneous-mixing) and BA (heterogeneous) networks.}\n  \\label{fig:degree-dist}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Parameter Calculation and Deterministic Analysis}\nThe transmission rate $\\beta$ for each network was set to yield $R_0 = 2.5$ using:\n\\begin{align*}\nR_0^{\\text{hom}} &= \\beta/\\gamma \\cdot\\langle k \\rangle\\\\\nR_0^{\\text{het}} &= \\beta/\\gamma \\cdot (\\langle k^2 \\rangle - \\langle k \\rangle)/\\langle k \\rangle\n\\end{align*}\n(see Table~\\ref{tab:params}). Mean and second moment of degree were computed directly from the generated graphs.\n\n\\subsection{Stochastic Simulations}\nWe simulated the SEIR epidemic on both networks using an agent-based stochastic simulator (FastGEMF). Initial conditions were set with $1\\%$ of nodes infectious and $1\\%$ removed, the rest susceptible. Each scenario was run for 180 days, averaging results over 8 stochastic realizations.\n\nFor comparison, the mean-field (ODE) SEIR model was numerically integrated with matched initial conditions and $\\beta$.\n\n\\section{Results}\n\\subsection{Deterministic and Stochastic Dynamics}\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{results-1-1.png}\n    \\caption{SEIR epidemic on ER (homogeneous-mixing) network.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{results-1-2.png}\n    \\caption{SEIR epidemic on BA (heterogeneous) network.}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{results-1-3.png}\n    \\caption{SEIR epidemic by mean-field ODE (homogeneous-mixing).}\n\\end{figure}\n\nSummary epidemic metrics are reported in Table~\\ref{tab:metrics}.\n\n\\input{table_metrics.tex}\n\n\\subsection{Key Observations}\nIncorporating degree heterogeneity markedly alters epidemic behavior:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item \\textbf{Peak Prevalence}: Lower in the heterogeneous network ($58$) vs. homogeneous ($145$), despite identical $R_0$.\n    \\item \\textbf{Final Epidemic Size}: Much smaller attack rate (total infections) in BA (457) vs. ER (829).\n    \\item \\textbf{Epidemic Duration}: BA exhibits prolonged epidemic (137 vs. 50 days for ER), with a slower, sustained transmission.\n    \\item \\textbf{Time to Peak}: Slightly delayed peak in BA, matching theory that super-spreaders are removed earlier, depleting network connectivity and slowing epidemic tail.\n    \\item \\textbf{Deterministic vs. Stochastic}: The ODE (homogeneous-mixing, mean-field) model fails to reproduce the more realistic curtailed peak and elongated duration seen with degree heterogeneity.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nOur findings confirm, both analytically and numerically, the critical role of network degree heterogeneity in shaping epidemic outcomes, consistent with literature suggesting that homogeneous-mixing assumptions typically overestimate epidemic peak and final size \\cite{Bansal2007, Barabasi1999, PMC7616000}. As also observed in previous studies \\cite{Endo2021, Zhu2023}, degree-heterogeneous networks early exhaust highly connected nodes, which suppresses subsequent propagation and produces a lower, protracted epidemic curve. This effect is amplified as variance in degree grows (BA $\\langle k^2 \\rangle$ nearly 2x ER).\n\nStochastic simulations further highlight that interventions targeting hubs or reducing variance (e.g., limiting large gatherings) can be disproportionately effective\\cite{PMC7616000}. Homogeneous-mixing ODEs provide only a first-order guide—potentially misleading for real networks.\n\nLimitations include the static nature of networks and the absence of clustering or behavioral feedback, which could further modulate epidemic curves. Future work should examine temporal network effects and targeted/vaccination interventions for hubs.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nDegree heterogeneity, typical of real-world social contact networks, dramatically changes epidemic outcomes in SEIR models. Compared to the classical homogeneous-mixing assumption, heterogeneous structure produces lower, delayed peaks, smaller epidemic sizes, and longer epidemic durations. Proper epidemic control and risk estimation require accounting for such heterogeneity.\n\n\\section*{References}\n\n\\begin{thebibliography}{99}\n\\bibitem{Read2008} J. M. Read, K. T. Eames, and W.
