                    "abstract": "BackgroundConfirmed H1N1 cases during late spring and summer 2009 in various countries showed a substantial age shift between importations and local transmission cases, with adults mainly responsible for seeding unaffected regions and children most frequently driving community outbreaks.MethodsWe introduce a multi-host stochastic metapopulation model with two age classes to analytically investigate the role of a heterogeneously mixing population and its associated non-homogeneous travel behaviors on the risk of a major epidemic. We inform the model with demographic data, contact data and travel statistics of Europe and Mexico, and calibrate it to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic early outbreak. We allow for variations of the model parameters to explore the conditions of invasion under different scenarios.ResultsWe derive the expression for the potential of global invasion of the epidemic that depends on the transmissibility of the pathogen, the transportation network and mobility features, the demographic profile and the mixing pattern. Higher assortativity in the contact pattern greatly increases the probability of spatial containment of the epidemic, this effect being contrasted by an increase in the social activity of adults vs. children. Heterogeneous features of the mobility network characterizing its topology and traffic flows strongly favor the invasion of the pathogen at the spatial level, as also a larger fraction of children traveling. Variations in the demographic profile and mixing habits across countries lead to heterogeneous outbreak situations. Model results are compatible with the H1N1 spatial transmission dynamics observed.ConclusionsThis work illustrates the importance of considering age-dependent mixing profiles and mobility features coupled together to study the conditions for the spatial invasion of an emerging influenza pandemic. Its results allow the immediate assessment of the risk of a major epidemic for a specific scenario upon availability of data, and the evaluation of the potential effectiveness of public health interventions targeting specific age groups, their interactions and mobility behaviors. The approach provides a general modeling framework that can be used for other types of partitions of the host population and applied to different settings.",

In this model, (N) represents non-believers, (E) denotes individuals exposed to the information but undecided, (A) refers to those who accept the information and may propagate it, and (B) are the believers. Similar to epidemiological models like SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered), the NEAB model adapts to study the spread of various types of information and behaviors within a population [20]. By combining elements of network theory [28] and epidemiology, the model investigates how behaviors and network structures influence information transmission. Our simulations, particularly when applied to real-world scenarios like misinformation spread during events such as COVID-19 or natural disasters, highlight key factors influencing dissemination [7]. Rates of exposure to misinformation, the transition of individuals from exposed to active spreaders, and the rate of recovery all play crucial roles in shaping how misinformation spreads [33]. Misinformation propagates more easily when exposure rates are high, while higher recovery rates help limit its spread. Sensitivity analysis shows that variations in (\u03b2) and (\u03b4) significantly impact the spread, emphasizing the importance of targeted interventions during these critical stages [22]. The objective of this study is to evaluate strategies for reducing the effects of misinformation on public discourse and health outcomes while offering insights into the key factors that drive its dissemination based on model simulations.",

This study adopts a stochastic model to capture random variability in individual interactions, often overlooked in deterministic models. The population is divided into four main categories: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infected (I), and Recovered (R), with transitions between categories determined by probabilities based on epidemiological parameters. Through simulations, the model demonstrates its capability to depict more realistic patterns of disease spread, including fluctuations in case numbers and epidemic duration. The findings indicate that stochastic variability plays a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of tuberculosis transmission, especially in small populations or when the number of individual contacts is limited.

In particular, we introduce modifications to this model to account for the potential changes in behavior patterns of individuals upon becoming symptomatic, as well as the tendency of a substantial proportion of those infected to remain asymptomatic. Methods: Using a generic network model where every potential contact exists with the same common probability, we conduct a simulation study in which we vary four key model parameters (transmission rate, probability of remaining asymptomatic, and the mean lengths of time spent in the exposed and infectious disease states) and examine the resulting impacts on various metrics of epidemic severity, including the effective reproduction number. We then consider the effects of a more complex network model. Results: We find that the mean length of time spent in the infectious state and the transmission rate are the most important model parameters, while the mean length of time spent in the exposed state and the probability of remaining asymptomatic are less important. We also find that the network structure has a significant impact on the dynamics of the disease spread. Conclusions: In this article, we present a modification to the network-based stochastic SEIR epidemic model which allows for modifications to the underlying contact network to account for the effects of quarantine. We also discuss the changes needed to the model to incorporate situations where some proportion of the individuals who are infected remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the disease.",

                    "abstract": "Epidemics spread through shipping networks and have dual characteristics as both biological sources of infection and triggers of cascading failures. However, existing resilience models fail to capture this dual and coupled dynamics. To minimize the cascading impacts of epidemics on global shipping networks, this paper proposes an innovative resilience assessment framework that considers the interaction between epidemic transmission and the shipping network cascading failure. First, a weighted shipping network topology is constructed based on route flow characteristics to quantify route frequency, stopping time, and the number of infected people, and the epidemic transmission across ports is modeled with an improved SEIR model, which contains a heterogeneous infectivity function and a dynamic transmission matrix, revealing a dual transmission mechanism inside and outside the ports. Second, a two-stage cascading failure model is developed: a direct failure triggered by infected people exceeding the threshold and an indirect failure triggered by the dynamic redistribution of loads. The load redistribution strategy is optimized to reconcile the residual port capacity and the risk of infection. Finally, a multidimensional resilience assessment framework covering structural destruction resistance, network efficiency, path redundancy, and a cascading failure propagation rate is constructed. Example validation shows that the improved load redistribution strategy reduces the maximum connected subgraph decay rate by 68.2%, reduces the cascading failure rate by 88%, and improves the peak network efficiency by 128.2%. In case of multi-source epidemics, the state of the network collapse can be shortened by 12 days if the following recovery strategy is adopted: initially repair high connectivity hubs (e.g., Port of Shanghai), and then repair high centrality nodes (e.g., Antwerp Port) to achieve a balance between recovery efficiency and network functionality. The research results reduce the risk of systemic disruptions in maritime networks and provide decision-making tools for dynamic port scheduling during pandemics.",

In actuality, the aleatory fluctuations factors present in the natural environment like storm surges, weather changes, and seismic tremors make the dissemination of epidemics susceptible to some randomness. This calls for a stronger mathematical formulation that takes into consideration this stochasticity effect. From this perspective, and in order to highlight in the same time the effect of the vaccination strategy, we survey in this paper an SVIR model with general incidence rates that is disturbed by both Brownian motions and L\u00e9vy jumps. Initially, we establish its well\u2010posedness in the sense that it has a unique positive and global\u2010in\u2010time solution. Then, we rely on some assumptions and nonstandard analytic techniques, to derive sufficient and almost necessary conditions for extinction, persistence in the mean, and also weak persistence. More explicitly, we identify firstly under some hypotheses a threshold \u03bb$$ \\lambda $$ between extinction and persistence in the mean. In other phrases, if \u03bb<0$$ \\lambda &lt;0 $$ , the infected population dies out while it persists in the mean when \u03bb>0$$ \\lambda &gt;0 $$ . Then, and by modifying the hypothetical framework in order to cover more incidence rates, we prove that \u03bb$$ \\lambda $$ can act also as a threshold between extinction and weak persistence.

Additionally, for comparison with sparse and heterogeneous networks, the pair approximation models were applied to a heterogeneous network with a degree distribution. The obtained phase diagram reveals that, upon increasing the degree of the original random regular networks and decreasing the effective connections by introducing void nodes accordingly, the final epidemic size of the sparse network is close to that of the random network with average degree of 4.

A better understanding of epidemic transmission dynamics can contribute to more efficient prevention and control measures. Compartmental models, which assume homogeneous mixing of the population, have been widely used in the study of epidemic transmission dynamics, while agent-based models rely on a network definition for individuals. In this study, we developed a real-scale contact-dependent dynamic (CDD) model and combined it with the traditional susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) compartment model. By considering individual random movement and disease spread, our simulations using the CDD-SEIR model reveal that the distribution of agent types in the community exhibits spatial heterogeneity. The estimated basic reproduction number R0 depends on group mobility, increasing logarithmically in strongly heterogeneous cases and saturating in weakly heterogeneous conditions. Notably, R0 is approximately independent of virus virulence when group mobility is low. We also show that transmission through small amounts of long-term contact is possible due to short-term contact patterns. The dependence of R0 on environment and individual movement patterns implies that reduced contact time and vaccination policies can significantly reduce the virus transmission capacity in situations where the virus is highly transmissible (i.e., R0 is relatively large). This work provides new insights into how individual movement patterns affect virus spreading and how to protect people more efficiently.",

Historically, there have been examples of declining coverage for vaccines, such as MMR vaccine and whole-cell pertussis vaccine, that are consistent with this theory. On the other hand, smallpox was globally eradicated by 1980 despite voluntary vaccination policies in many jurisdictions. Previous modeling studies of the interplay between disease dynamics and individual vaccinating behavior have assumed that infection is transmitted in a homogeneously mixing population. By comparison, here we simulate transmission of a vaccine-preventable SEIR infection through a random, static contact network. Individuals choose whether to vaccinate based on infection risks from neighbors, and based on vaccine risks. When neighborhood size is small, rational vaccinating behavior results in rapid containment of the infection through voluntary ring vaccination. As neighborhood size increases (while the average force of infection is held constant), a threshold is reached beyond which the infection can break through partially vaccinated rings, percolating through the whole population and resulting in considerable epidemic final sizes and a large number vaccinated. The former outcome represents convergence between individually and socially optimal outcomes, whereas the latter represents their divergence, as observed in most models of individual vaccinating behavior that assume homogeneous mixing. Similar effects are observed in an extended model using smallpox-specific natural history and transmissibility assumptions. This work illustrates the significant qualitative differences between behavior\u2013infection dynamics in discrete contact-structured populations versus continuous unstructured populations. This work also shows how disease eradicability in populations where voluntary vaccination is the primary control mechanism may depend partly on whether the disease is transmissible only to a few close social contacts or to a larger subset of the population.",

Individual- level variation in susceptibility or infectiousness due to predictable biological, behavioural or random factors can modify the transmission dynamics and cause deviation from what is expected from models assuming that transmission is homogeneous. One of the important sources of heterogeneity are social contact networks; respiratory infectious diseases including influenza and COVID-19 spread over social contact networks that are formed through mixing in multiple social settings. Households and schools are important places of transmission of many respiratory infectious diseases (although the role of schools in the transmission of COVID-19 remain unclear). Schoolchildren are often the main drivers of influenza epidemics, and they further spread the disease to other age groups by introducing infection into households and other settings. However, detailed transmission dynamics in households and schools have not been fully understood; in particular, it is not well known how group sizes and contact patterns affect transmission risks in heterogeneous populations. The underlying mechanisms of variations in transmission may not necessarily be explained by known factors. Even in such cases, quantifying such variation can be useful in characterising the transmission dynamics. SARS-CoV-2, along with other related coronaviruses, exhibits strong dispersion in the number of secondary transmissions per case. In addition to the basic reproduction number R0, which represents the mean number of secondary transmissions in fully susceptible population, the degree of variability around the mean highlights the importance of superspreading and potentially informs control policy targeting superspreading events. This PhD study attempts to further improve the current understanding of how heterogeneity affects transmission dynamics, inference and public health applications.

In recent years, health sensing through smartphones has been more and more popular with the improvement of sensors and processing capacity. In this paper, we focus on capturing a fingertip video with a smartphone to monitor blood pressure. Current measurement techniques, however, require intrusive methods or inaccurate measurements. We present a low-cost system that uses smartphone cameras and a light source and our self-built convolutional neural network to measure blood pressure. We recruit 34 volunteers to verify our method. After 10-fold cross-validation, the mean absolute errors of our model for systolic and diastolic blood pressure were 4.44 mmHg and 3.68 mmHg, meeting the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) and British Hypertension Society (BHS) Abstract.

Abstract. Membrane proteins account for approximately 30% of all proteins in a cell. These proteins are difficult to study due to their hydrophobic surface and reliance on the original in vivo environment. This paper proposes TooT-BERT-M, a technique for detecting membrane proteins based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) representation. BERT is a technique for learning contextual embeddings for individual amino acids in a protein sequence. We trained a Logistic Regression to discriminate membrane proteins from non-membrane proteins and obtained a classification accuracy of 92.46% and an MCC of 0.85. Additionally, we compared frozen and fine-tuned BERT representations to determine which should be used for membrane protein identification. The results are cutting-edge in predicting membrane proteins and statistically significant compared to previous work. Abstract. An evolutionary algorithm is used to evolve personal contact networks representing the individuals in a population and the interactions between them. Such networks can be used to track the progress of an epidemic, as it passes from infected individuals to others. Two fitness functions are used: epidemic duration and epidemic spread. Each of these is evaluated in the context of new variants being introduced during the course of the epidemic. Individuals infected with one variant obtain immunity to that variant and possible partial immunity to future variants. Two frameworks for epidemic variants are presented. In the first, infectivity is coupled directly to how well an individual\u2019s im munity covers the variant. In the second, infectivity is decoupled, causing a much higher number of infections but with many of lessened severity due to immunity. Abstract. Many problems in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics involve classification, such as the classification of cell samples into malignant (cancer) or benign (normal). For such tasks, an evolutionary deep neural network that employs an evolutionary algorithm to evolve deep heterogeneous feed-forward neural networks (EvoDNN) can be employed. While the majority of current feed-forward neural networks employ user-defined homogeneous activation functions, EvoDNN creates heterogeneous multi-layer networks where each neuron's activation function is not statically defined by the user, but dynamically updated during evolution. Activation functions in EvoDNN do not need to be differentiable. This feature gives users a great degree of flexibility over which activation functions EvoDNN can utilize. This paper extends previous work on EvoDNN by analyzing a more extensive set of data sets and studying variations of the internal topology of the EvoDNN model. We also compare our model to several other popular models and demonstrate superior performance on several data sets. Abstract. LiMs (Short Linear Motifs) are patterns of three to \u223c 20 amino acids within proteins that are sufficient to fulfill certain functions. SLiMs play a critical role in many biological processes. Hence, with the increasing quantity of biological data, it is important to develop algorithms that can quickly find patterns in large databases of DNA, RNA and protein sequences. Previous research has been very successful at applying deep learning methods to the problems of motif detection as well as classification of biological sequences. There are, however, limitations to these approaches. Most are limited to finding motifs of a single length. In addition, most research has focused on DNA and RNA, both of which use a four-letter alphabet. A few of these have attempted to apply deep learning methods on the larger, twenty letter, alphabet of proteins. We present an enhanced deep learning model, called DeePSLiM, capable of detecting predictive SLiMs in protein sequences. The model is a shallow network that can be trained quickly on large amounts of data. The SLiMs are predictive because they can be used to classify the sequences into their respective families. In this study, first, we propose a new deep learning approach for finding predictive SLiMs in protein sequences. Then, we use these predictive SLiMs for the classification task of protein sequences to evaluate our proposed method. The model was able to reach scores of 94.5% on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and Matthews-correlation coefficient, as well as 99.9% area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). Abstract. Inspired by the resent trend of binary neural networks, where weights and activation thresholds are represented using 1 and -1 such that they can be stored in 1-bit instead of full precision, we explore this approach for gene regulatory network modeling. An evolutionary computation approach to learn binary threshold networks is presented. In particular, we consider differential evolution and particle swarm optimization. We test our method by inferring binary threshold networks of a regulatory network of Quorum sensing systems in bacterium Paraburkholderia phytofirmans PsJN. We present results for weights having only 1 and -1 values, and consider different activation thresholds. Full binary threshold networks were found with minimum error (2 bits), whereas when the binary restriction is relaxed for the activation thresholds, networks with 0 bit error were found. Abstract. De novo drug design involves the selection of molecular candidates with improved pharmacokinetic properties. Although multi-objective metaheuristics have been proposed in the literature, the available work converts the multi-objective problem into a single objective by employing a weighted sum fitness approach. In this preliminary study, we provide a comparison between two cooperative multi-objective optimizers using particle swarm optimization and differential evolution algorithm using Pareto fitness evaluation method for the aforementioned problem. Preliminary results indicate that the proposed differential evolution algorithm outperforms the particle swarm based approach. However, this study will further examine variants of the said optimizers, and carry out a scalability study with increase in the number of objectives including binding affinity from molecular docking as an objective measure. Abstract. The computational analyses of single-cell data, aimed at elucidating and characterizing the functional roles of known and putative novel cell types, are enabling a thorough understanding of the processes driving cell development and pathology progression. The isolation of specific cell types is a crucial step to perform detailed analyses but requires the identification of succinct marker panels, which include genes that refer to cell surface proteins and clusters of differentiation molecules. This still represents a challenging NP-hard computational problem, which can be tackled through global optimization techniques. In this work, we formulate the marker panel identification problem as a multi-objective optimization problem, where the first objective regards the capability of the marker panels to accurately discriminate different cell types, while the second objective is related to the number of genes to include in the panel. In particular, we compared the performance of two multi-objective optimization algorithms, as well as of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) when c",
