                    "abstract": "Information regarding vaccines from sources such as health services, media, and social networks can significantly shape vaccination decisions. In particular, the dissemination of negative information can contribute to vaccine hesitancy, thereby exacerbating infectious disease outbreaks. This study investigates strategies to mitigate anti-vaccine social contagion through effective counter-campaigns that disseminate positive vaccine information and encourage vaccine uptake, aiming to reduce the size of epidemics. In a coupled agent-based model that consists of opinion and disease diffusion processes, we explore and compare different heuristics to design positive campaigns based on the network structure and local presence of negative vaccine attitudes. We examine two campaigning regimes: a static regime with a fixed set of targets, and a dynamic regime in which targets can be updated over time. We demonstrate that strategic targeting and engagement with the dynamics of anti-vaccine influence diffusion in the network can effectively mitigate the spread of anti-vaccine sentiment, thereby reducing the epidemic size. However, the effectiveness of the campaigns differs across different targeting strategies and is impacted by a range of factors. We find that the primary advantage of static campaigns lies in their capacity to act as an obstacle, preventing the clustering of emerging anti-vaccine communities, thereby resulting in smaller and unconnected anti-vaccine groups. On the other hand, dynamic campaigns reach a broader segment of the population and adapt to the evolution of anti-vaccine diffusion, not only protecting susceptible agents from negative influence but also fostering positive propagation within negative regions.",

                    "abstract": "Forecasting temporal processes such as virus spreading in epidemics often requires more than just observed time-series data, especially at the beginning of a wave when data is limited. Traditional methods employ mechanistic models like the SIR family, which make strong assumptions about the underlying spreading process, often represented as a small set of compact differential equations. Data-driven methods such as deep neural networks make no such assumptions and can capture the generative process in more detail, but fail in long-term forecasting due to data limitations. We propose a new hybrid method called MP-PINN (Multi-Phase Physics-Informed Neural Network) to overcome the limitations of these two major approaches. MP-PINN instils the spreading mechanism into a neural network, enabling the mechanism to update in phases over time, reflecting the dynamics of the epidemics due to policy interventions. Experiments on COVID-19 waves demonstrate that MP-PINN achieves superior performance over pure data-driven or model-driven approaches for both short-term and long-term forecasting.",

They are constructed as a 2-dimensional Newman and Watts model (500 \u00d7 500 square lattice with additional shortcuts), where the dynamics involves rewiring shortcuts in every time step of the epidemic spread. We assume susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model of the disease. We study the behaviour of the epidemic over the range of shortcut probability per underlying bond \u03d5 = 0\u20130.5. We calculate percolation thresholds for the epidemic outbreak, for which numerical results are checked against an approximate analytical model. We find a significant lowering of percolation thresholds on the dynamic network in the parameter range given. The result shows the behaviour of the epidemic on dynamic network is that of a static small world with the number of shortcuts increased by 20.7\u00b11.4 %, while the overall qualitative behaviour stays the same. We derive corrections to the analytical model which account for the effect. For both dynamic and static small worlds we observe suppression of the average epidemic size dependence on network size in comparison with the finite-size scaling known for regular lattice. We also study the effect of dynamics for several rewiring rates relative to infectious period of the disease.\n",

For example, currently, the debate continues to reveal when and where the first spread of COVID-19 occured. For this problem, most of the works have assumed a static network topology, that is, the connections between nodes do not change over time. This is impractical because many nodes have some mobility in the network, or the connections can be changed. In this paper, we focus on the dynamic network, in the sense that the node connectivity varies over time. We first introduce a simple dynamic model, named k-flip dynamic such that \n \n \n \n k \n > \n 0 \n \n \n \n connections in the network may be changed with some probability at each time. Next, we design a proper estimation algorithm using some investigation for the contact information between infected nodes, named dynamic network source estimation (DNSE)(k) for the dynamic model. We perform various simulations for the algorithm compared to several existing source estimation methods. Our results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms and is efficient for finding the epidemic source compared to other methods. Further, we see that the detection probability for our proposed algorithm can be above 45% when we use budget to investigate the contact information from the infected nodes under some practical setting of k.",

A simple extension of the Watts-Strogatz model is proposed to control the graph properties of the network such that the corresponding physical properties can be studied with simulations. The architecture of polymer networks assembled with a dynamic curing approach were compared with the extended Watts-Strogatz model, and found to agree surprisingly well. The final cured structures of the dynamically-assembled networks were nearly an intermediate between lattice and random connections due to restrictions imposed by the finite length of the chains. Further, the uni-axial stress response, character of the bond breaking, and non-affine displacements of fully-cured glassy networks were analyzed as a function of the degree of disorder in the network architecture. It is shown that the architecture strongly affects the network stability, flow stress, onset of bond breaking, and ultimate stress while leaving the modulus and yield point nearly unchanged. The results show that internal restrictions imposed by the network architecture alter the chain-level response through changes to the crosslink dynamics in the flow regime and through the degree of coordinated chain failure at the ultimate stress. The properties considered here are shown to be sensitive to even incremental changes to the architecture and, therefore, the overall network architecture, beyond simple defects, is predicted to be a meaningful physical parameter in the mechanics of glassy polymer networks.",

The results can provide guidance to public health authorities on comprehensive prevention and control for the new Mpox virus strain in the Democratic Republic of Congo as of December 2023. Methods We develop a two-layer Watts-Strogatz network model. The basic reproduction number is calculated using the next-generation matrix approach. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) optimization algorithm is used to fit Mpox cases in Canada into the network model. Numerical simulations are used to assess the impact of mitigation strategies and human behavior on the final epidemic size. Results Our results show that the contact transmission rate of low-risk groups and susceptible humans increases when the contact transmission rate of high-risk groups and susceptible humans is controlled as the Mpox epidemic spreads. The contact transmission rate of high-risk groups after May 18, 2022, is approximately 20% lower than that before May 18, 2022. Our findings indicate a positive correlation between the basic reproduction number and the level of heterogeneity in human contacts, with the basic reproduction number estimated at 2.3475 (95% CI: 0.0749\u20136.9084). Reducing the average number of sexual contacts to two per week effectively reduces the reproduction number to below one. Conclusion We need to pay attention to the re-emergence of the epidemics caused by low-risk groups when an outbreak dominated by high-risk groups is under control. Numerical simulations show that reducing the average number of sexual contacts to two per week is effective in slowing down the rapid spread of the epidemic.

                    "abstract": "Connecting the different scales of epidemic dynamics, from individuals to communities to nations, remains one of the main challenges of disease modeling. Here, we revisit one of the largest public health efforts deployed against a localized epidemic: the 2014-2016 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) epidemic in Sierra Leone. We leverage the data collected by the surveillance and contact tracing protocols of the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other responding partners to validate a network epidemiology framework connecting the population (incidence), community (local forecasts), and individual (secondary infections) scales of disease transmission. In doing so, we gain a better understanding of what brought the EVD epidemic to an end: Reduction of introduction in new clusters (primary cases), and not reduction in local transmission patterns (secondary infections). We also find that the first 90 days of the epidemic contained enough information to produce probabilistic forecasts of EVD cases; forecasts which we show are confirmed independently by both disease surveillance and contact tracing. Altogether, using data available two months before the start of the international support to the local response, network epidemiology could have inferred heterogeneity in local transmissions, the risk for superspreading events, and probabilistic forecasts of eventual cases per community. We expect that our framework will help connect large data collection efforts with individual behavior, and help reduce uncertainty during health emergencies and emerging epidemics. Infectious diseases are constant yet often unpredictable threats. The 2014-2016 EVD epidemic in West Africa alone took over ten thousand lives and led to aid distributions nearing $10 billion from 70 countries1. There were two major contributing factors: (i) local health systems were ill-prepared, with Ebola-affected countries falling at least 90% short of WHO recommendations for numbers of doctors and nurses per capita2; and (ii) the declaration of the Public Health Emergency of International Concern came late: over 4 months after the first international transmission event3. This last systemic failure likely reflects the fact that EVD outbreaks, like most emerging outbreaks, are highly unpredictable and variable. Before 2014, recent Ebola outbreaks occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2014 and 2012, South Sudan in 2004, Gabon in 2001, and notably in Uganda in 2012 and 2007, but these never exceeded 500 geographically contained cases4. In stark contrast, there were nearly 30,000 cases over 10 countries during the West African epidemic with widespread transmission in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and other cases in Italy, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The spread and impact of EVD spread is determined not only by the biology of the virus but also in large part by societal and behavioral factors5, 6. Consequently, in the country that reported the most number of cases and deaths, Sierra Leone, the intervention aimed to alleviate disease burden on a strained healthcare system focused on supportive care7 by investing significantly in behavioral interventions ranging from community engagement8 to traditional contact tracing9. As we will see, ar X iv :2 11 1. 08 68 6v 1 [ qbi o. PE ] 1 6 N ov 2 02 1 the latter revealed the variability of Ebola transmissions, suggesting that less than 5% of Ebola cases caused more than one secondary infection over the course of the epidemic, yet some individuals infected dozens of others. We can now leverage the data collected in these efforts to develop the next generation of epidemic forecasting tools through a first study of the unique ethical and anonymized Sierra Leone Ebola Database (SLED), which consolidates data from the Government of Sierra Leone and a range of responding partners10, 11. Here, we present case and contact tracing data from SLED. We first show that distributions of secondary infections (or transmissions) per case did not change significantly over time and that reduction in the spread of EVD was likely due to a reduction in its introduction in new communities. To validate these data, we then show that network epidemiology models informed by contact-tracing data can provide probabilistic forecasts of epidemics at the village level, capturing the heterogeneity of disease spread as well as its randomness. This network approach contrasts with the traditional deterministic forecasts from conventional compartmental models whose only uncertainty stems from parameter confidence rather than from the intrinsic randomness of epidemics. Importantly, we also show how to infer valuable individual-level contact statistics from population-level incidence data. Our network epidemiology framework helps us better understand the dynamics of EVD in Sierra Leone. It also opens the way to multi-scale inference of epidemic dynamics, connecting population incidence, probabilistic forecasts in communities, and individual-level heterogeneity. One key obstacle that precluded previous validation of models accounting for individual heterogeneity is the rarity of multi-scale data. Most epidemic data are coarse-grained over large populations (e.g. nations, states, etc.), while models often require individual level data (e.g. distribution of secondary infections or contact patterns) to provide forecasts at the level of communities (e.g., villages or towns). In that respect, the large contact tracing and data collection efforts accomplished during the EVD epidemic in Sierra Leone are unique in their scale and quality. During the West African EVD epidemic, contact tracing efforts were sustained to varying degree but spanned the entire epidemic13, see Fig. 1. These efforts followed the guidelines of the World Health Organization on how to establish and conduct contact tracing during filovirus disease outbreaks9. Therein, contact tracing is defined as the identification and follow-up of persons who may have come into contact with an infected individual. Identification is done by investigating high-risk categories of contacts, which include but are not limited to individuals who: (i) touched an infected patient\u2019s body fluids (blood, vomit, saliva, urine, faeces), (ii) had direct physical contact with the body of a patient (alive or dead), (iii) touched or cleaned the linens or clothes of a patient, (iv) were laboratory workers who had direct contact with specimens collected from suspected Ebola patients without appropriate infection prevention and control measures, or (v) were patients who received care in a hospital where EVD patients were treated before the initiation of strict isolation and infection prevention and control measures. For disease modeling and forecasting, several key insights can be extracted from contact tracing data 14: Identifying the critical types of contacts, settings and mechanisms that promote transmission, inferring the frequency of superspreading events, and so on. The distribution of secondary infections identified through contact tracing around a given index case also reflects the heterogeneity of disease spread15, 16. In particular, the average number of secondary infections directly reflects the basic reproduction number R0 of the epidemic, which is often the sole focus of disease models ignoring the richness and heterogeneity of the underlying distribution. For the EVD epidemic in Sierra Leone, the distribution of secondary infections collected through contact tracing is shown for three key periods of the epidemic in Fig. 1. First, we note the absence of data regarding cases that did not cause any secondary infections. This is a direct shortcoming of the data collection which did not distinguish between cases where contact tracing efforts did not identify secondary infections and cases where there were no contact tracing efforts whatsoever. Second, the observed distributions show significant heterogeneity, stressing the need to account for more than simply their average (e.g., R0). In individuals at the source of at least one transmission event, we find an average of roughly 1.6 secondary infections in all three periods (1.624, 1.622, and 1.660 respectively). Yet, out of cases that do transmit the disease, 85% lead to a single secondary infection while at least 1 in a thousand cases leads to 10 infections or more. It is therefore dangerous to assume that the EVD epidemic was driven by average individuals. The majority of cases create fewer secondary infections than the average, while a minority create an order of magnitude more infections than average16, 17. Third, and perhaps most strikingly, the distribution of secondary infections do not statistically-significantly change across the three observed periods. These periods \u2014 May through September 2014, October to mid-November 2014, and onward \u2014 were chosen to contain similar numbers of contact tracing data but also roughly correspond to the onset of the epidemic peak, the epidemic peak itself, and the decay of the epidemic. One could reasonably assume that the large public health efforts which helped limit the spread of EVD would here be reflected as a decrease in the frequency of higher numbers of secondary infections. However, while public health efforts did reduce mortality 75 to 40%7, 18, they did not appear to influence the distribution of secondary infections as observed through contact tracing. This is a surprising result considering the scale of epidemic control efforts. We thus aim to validate this distribution of secondary infections. Are these contact tracing data reliable enough to inform epidemic models and forecasts? The contact tracing data is of course not perfect, with probable biases around the fact that",

The extent of these bifurcations is modulated by the graph heterogeneity, the recovery parameter, and the network size. In the limit of large, well-mixed networks, the behavior approaches that of difference equation models, suggesting this behavior is a universal feature of all discrete-time SIR models.

Recently, network-based disease models have integrated traditional compartment-based modeling with real-world contact graphs and shown promising results. However, in an ongoing epidemic, future contact network patterns are not observed yet. To address this, we use aggregated static networks to approximate future contacts for disease modeling. The standard method in the literature concatenates all edges from a dynamic graph into one collapsed graph, called the full static graph. However, the full static graph often leads to severe overestimation of key epidemic characteristics. Therefore, we propose two novel static network approximation methods, DegMST and EdgeMST, designed to preserve the sparsity of real world contact network while remaining connected. DegMST and EdgeMST use the frequency of temporal edges and the node degrees respectively to preserve sparsity. Our analysis show that our models more closely resemble the network characteristics of the dynamic graph compared to the full static ones. Moreover, our analysis on seven real-world contact networks suggests EdgeMST yield more accurate estimations of disease dynamics for epidemic forecasting when compared to the standard full static method.",

In particular, the dissemination of negative information can contribute to vaccine hesitancy, thereby exacerbating infectious disease outbreaks. This study investigates strategies to mitigate anti-vaccine social contagion through effective counter-campaigns that disseminate positive vaccine information and encourage vaccine uptake, aiming to reduce the size of epidemics. In a coupled agent-based model that consists of opinion and disease diffusion processes, we explore and compare different heuristics to design positive campaigns based on the network structure and local presence of negative vaccine attitudes. We examine two campaigning regimes: a static regime with a fixed set of targets, and a dynamic regime in which targets can be updated over time. We demonstrate that strategic targeting and engagement with the dynamics of anti-vaccine influence diffusion in the network can effectively mitigate the spread of anti-vaccine sentiment, thereby reducing the epidemic size. However, the effectiveness of the campaigns differs across different targeting strategies and is impacted by a range of factors. We find that the primary advantage of static campaigns lies in their capacity to act as an obstacle, preventing the clustering of emerging anti-vaccine communities, thereby resulting in smaller and unconnected anti-vaccine groups. On the other hand, dynamic campaigns reach a broader segment of the population and adapt to the evolution of anti-vaccine diffusion, not only protecting susceptible agents from negative influence but also fostering positive propagation within negative regions.",

The model allows us to simulate various scenarios to understand how epidemic spreading can be affected by misinformation spreading through one particular social media platform. Using this model, we compare a worst-case scenario, in which individuals become misinformed after a single exposure to low-credibility content, to a best-case scenario where the population is highly resilient to misinformation.

One layer embodies face-to-face contacts, with a biological infection transmission following a simple contagion model, the SIR process. Awareness, modelled by the linear threshold model, a complex contagion, spreads over a social layer and induces behaviour that lowers the chance of a biological infection occurring. It may be provoked by the presence of either aware or infectious neighbours. We introduce a novel model combining these influences through a convex combination, creating a continuum between pure social contagion and local risk perception. Simulation of the model shows distinct effects arising from the awareness sources. Also, for convex combinations where both input sources are of importance, awareness cascades that are not attributable to only one of these sources, emerge.

The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Hospitalized-Critical-Deaths (SEIR-HCD) model proposed in this research work is identified as a valuable tool for capturing the complex dynamics of disease transmission, healthcare demands, and mortality rates during epidemics.\n\nBackground: The spread of viral diseases is a major problem for public health services all over the world. Understanding how diseases spread is important in order to take the right steps to stop them. In epidemiology, the SIS, SIR, and SEIR models have been used to mimic and study how diseases spread in groups of people.\n\nMethodology: This research focuses on the integration of air traffic network data into the SEIR-HCD model to enhance the understanding of disease spread in air travel settings. By incorporating air traffic data, the model considers the role of travel patterns and connectivity in disease dissemination, enabling the identification of high-risk routes, airports, and regions.\n\nContribution: This research contributes to the field of epidemiology by enhancing our understanding of disease spread dynamics through the application of the SIS, SIR, and SEIR-HCD models. The findings provide insights into the factors influencing disease transmission, allowing for the development of effective strategies for disease control and prevention.\n\nFindings: The interplay between local outbreaks and global disease dissemination through air travel is empirically explored. The model can be further used for the evaluation of the effectiveness of surveillance and early detection measures at airports and transportation hubs. The proposed research contributes to proactive and evidence-based strategies for disease prevention and control, offering insights into the impact of air travel on disease transmission and supporting public health interventions in air traffic networks.\n\nRecommendations for Practitioners: Government intervention can be studied during difficult times which plays as a moderating variable that can enhance or hinder the efficacy of epidemic intelligence efforts within air traffic networks. Expert collaboration from various fields, including epidemiology, aviation, data science, and public health with an interdisciplinary approach can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the disease spread dynamics in air traffic networks. \n\nRecommendation for Researchers: Researchers can collaborate with international health organizations and authorities to share their research findings and contribute to a global understanding of disease spread in air traffic networks.\n\nImpact on Society: This research has significant implications for society. By providing a deeper understanding of disease spread dynamics, it enables policymakers, public health officials, and practitioners to make informed decisions to mitigate disease outbreaks. The recommendations derived from this research can aid in the development of effective strategies to control and prevent the spread of infectious diseases, ultimately leading to improved public health outcomes and reduced societal disruptions.\n\nFuture Research: Practitioners of the research can contribute more effectively to disease outbreaks within the context of air traffic networks, ultimately helping to protect public health and global travel. By considering air traffic patterns, the SEIR-HCD model contributes to more accurate modeling and prediction of disease outbreaks, aiding in the development of proactive and evidence-based strategies to manage and mitigate the impact of infectious diseases in the context of air travel.\n\n",

                    "abstract": "This study is devoted to applying parametric network models for the process of defining a guided tour route within route networks on the example of Denmark. This is caused by difficulty in determining variations when organizing guided tours. Under the actual digitization conditions, tourist and excursion bureaus are being restructured from static organizations administering various excursions into dynamic ones. They are actually getting adjusted to the customers\u2019 needs and demands, taking into account the actual possibilities for covering a certain topic by the tour party within a route. The main problem encountered by tourist and excursion bureaus is the following. Although the nomenclature of presented guided tours is established by the economic entity independently, those are not always carried out according to a clearly defined itinerary and on the same conditions for all participants. When providing such services, customers\u2019 demands and service peculiarities are not known in advance. The purpose of the present study is to provide a substantive basis for routing in tourist and excursion bureaus, based on parametric network models and taking into account the peculiarities of dynamically adaptable tables containing the best routes. To achieve the research goal, network planning methods were used, such as analytical, tabular, cloud computing in the AnyLogic Cloud environment. As a result of the study, a substantive basis of routing of the tourist route was presented for tourist and excursion bureaus, through their parametric network models. The study was implemented at the sample of the Denmark Tour -Your Guide Office, a company founded within cooperation with Russian, Ukrainian, and Denmark partners and providing travel services within the Denmark tourist market. The Office includes about 20 affiliates in Denmark, where route networks have already been adapted to designing tours in practice and parameterization of such networks is well underway, in particular by shifting the focus from the route distance rate to minimization of transfers between attraction sites. However, to provide a substantive basis for the routing in a tourist office, parameters of the routing networks should be determined not only based on the list of actions (activities) to be carried out, but also on their minimum and maximum possible duration. A lack of due attention to the servicing time for the tour groups will lead to breaking tour schedules. Thus, in 2020, as a result of the inefficient parameterization at Denmark Tour - Your Guide, about 5-6 tours around Aalborg and its vicinity were cancelled monthly. Denmark Tour- Your Guide incurs monthly profit losses at 15% in 4-6 tours around Aarhus and its surroundings, Jursland peninsula, rated at a fixed cost, as the result of payment of a fixed cost for the selected excursions. A similar situation, with breaking tour schedules and monthly losses incurred, is common with tourist and excursion bureaus in various countries around the world, including Ukraine. According to the results of the study, it is marked that the routing of tourist itineraries designed by tourist agencies, based on parametric network models turns their static time reserves and operational metrics into dynamic values depending on the duration of the tour activities. This not only ensures following schedules properly in all tours but also minimizes monthly profit loss, at an estimated EUR 2,250 for the Aalborg and its surroundings routes. Meanwhile, there may be situations where it is not possible to change the total tour cost. For example, in the company Denmark Tour - Your Guide, when working with intermediate parties, this price is fixed. To prevent incurring monthly losses within 15% of the profits for 4-6 tours of Aarhus and its surroundings, Jursland peninsula, Aalborg and Surroundings, it is necessary to make some quite specific adjustments in some activities at the sites. These should take into account the time reserve values on the longest route. A special tour activity complex is to be completed, with a maximum difference in early and late schedule times, standard and urgent pricing for the site operations). A procedure is compiled for minimizing losses in routes (over 8K euro annually), providing for completion of the activity complex within the schedule with a minimum additional charge to the operating metric (the route price), since it is not reimbursed by the tourists. It is important that the results presented should identify the path adjustments of each route simultaneously, taking into account the actual time reserve (available based on the tour group location and the previouisly completed schedule items on the tour). Prospects for practical implementation of the presented substantiation basis for the itinerary routing to be used in tourist and excursion bureaus, based on parametric network models, are in establishing facilities for creating dynamic graphic images of the whole tour procedure, in the form of a directed graph of the route network.",

                    "abstract": "Bug localization is the task to locate the source code entities which are relevant from the bug report. Manual bug localization is a time consuming task as developers has to go through thousands of source code entities to locate the relevant one. Current research provides methods as various IR techniques, classifiers, combination of classifiers to improve bug localization. Due to the increasing size and complexity of current software applications, automated solutions for bug localization can significantly reduce human effort and software maintenance cost. This can be done with the help of an Ant Colony Optimization Technique. Keywords\u2014 Bug Localization, Information Retrieval (IR), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Pheromone Trails. A Review: Bug Localization Using Ant Colony Optimization 171 important terms in the query and document, and assigning each greater weight for matching.[3] Ant Colony Optimization: ACO technique comes under the swarm intelligence [Daniel Markel and Martin Middendorf. It is used in various dynamic applications. Ants started from nest in the search of food which is away from nest. Each ant follow different path to reach to the food source and secrete pheromone liquid at the path as a mark to attract other ants. Ants choose the path depending upon the pheromone and path is marked after collecting food. So at the end shortest path has the highest probability. The act of making trail of pheromone liquid is very useful to find out good food source direction. Moreover, ACO deals with a process in which decreasing in amount of pheromone deposited on every path by the time is known as trail pheromone evaporation. When they complete their search to find out best result or to reach final destination, they update their trail to attract other ants. Each conspiratorial problem defines its own updating criteria depending on its own local search and global search respectively. Ants are able to find shortest path on the basis of pheromone information laid on ground by other ants of same colony. Ant searching for food goes for all possible trails, but in last chooses the trail with largest deposit pheromone and update according to the latest pheromones. There is population of ants in ants system, which is working as agent to find out shortest path and communicate with other ants. When reached its destination, the direction of path it follow is based upon the amount of pheromone it detects and is made by decision probabilistic. II. ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION FLOWCHART (ACO) A scheme of an ACO flowchart in figure 1 is given in the following. 1. Represent the solution space by a construction graph. 2. Set ACO parameters and initialize pheromone trails. 3. Generate ant solution from each ants walk on the construction graph 4. Update pheromone intensities. 5. Go to step 3, and repeat until convergence or termination conditions are fulfilled. The large majorities of these applications are to NP-hard problems; that is, to problems for which the best known algorithms that guarantee to identify an optimal solution have exponential time worst case complexity. The use of such algorithms is often infeasible in practice, and ACO algorithms can be useful for quickly finding high-quality solutions. ACO algorithms are based on a parameterized probabilistic model the pheromone model, is used to model the chemical pheromone trails. Figure 1: Flow chart of ACO Birinderjit Singh Kalyan 172 III. ADVANTAGES OF ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION ACO displays powerful robustness. 2. It has an advantage of distributed computation which avoids premature convergence. 3. It is adaptive in nature and can adapt changes easily. 4. It gives positive feedback which leads to discovery of good solutions. 5. It can be used in dynamic applications. 6.To communicate with each other ants use pheromone liquid. 7. The whole process is done in an organized manner. IV. DIFFERENT BUG-LOCALIZATION TECHNIQUES A) Static Analysis : Static analysis of software program source codes is a kind of formal analysis where all possible paths of the source code are explored. This kind of analysis strongly depends on the syntax and the semantics of the underlying programming language. This kind of analysis is performed without actually executing the program. Some of the prominent methods of static analysis are Model Checking [Clarke et al. 1999], Data-Flow Analysis and Abstract Interpretation [Cousot and Cousot 1977]. By a straightforward reduction of the Halting Problem [Halting Problem 1930] it is possible to prove that (for any Turing complete language) finding all possible run-time errors in an arbitrary program (or more generally any kind of violation of a specification on the final result of a program) is undecidable: there is no mechanical method that can always answer truthfully and faithfully whether a given program may or may not exhibit runtime errors. In spite of this inherent limitations there are a few tools that implements static analysis based software verification method : BLAST [Henzinger et al. 2002], Clang [Lattner 2007] and Microsoft\u2019s SLAM Toolkit [Microsoft Research 2010] are among the most prominent and mostly used tools. One of the most severe limitation of this method is that it often suffers from capacity limitations as reported widely in literature. Intuitively static analysis based methods try to explore all possible executions of the program. Since the number of executions is infinite (even for very simple and relatively small program), hence static analysis based methods often do not scale. In this survey static analysis and related methods are not our prime objective. In the next section we introduce statistical analysis based bug localization briefly. B) Statistical Analysis :To alleviate the capacity related issues, researchers have studied program bug localization methodologies based on dynamic analysis. This methodology has a common framework in all of its variants : the program source code is co-executed along with a large number of possible test cases and execution traces are dumped. Then, suitable machine learning and data mining algorithms are applied to extract out likely invariants and possible bug locations in the software program. Clearly, even if a large number of test suites are used to generate the trace data, it is still impossible to execute all possible paths in the program. However, this makes the problem of invariant generation and bug localization more tractable. But obviously it comes for a price; some of the invariants generated may be spurious which are true for those test cases but do not hold good in general for the program. Also, in case of bug localization it may give rise to false positives. Over the past decades several such dynamic trace based software bug localization techniques have been proposed by the researchers. Some of those techniques use a hybrid approach where knowledge learned from dynamic traces is used to prune significant portion of the state space of static analysis making it more tractable. holmes [Chilimbi et al. 2009] is one such method. In some other methods, different state-of-the-art data mining algorithms along with rigorous statistical analyses are performed over the dynamic traces to locate possible bug locations in the program. CBI [Liblit 2007], [Liblit et al. 2005], SOBER [Liu et al. 2005], [Liu et al. 2006] and DES [Hu et al. 2008] are some of the prominent statistical analysis based bug localization techniques. This survey by no means is as comprehensive as the numerously vast and diverse works that have been done in the domain of software bug localization. In this survey paper A Review: Bug Localization Using Ant Colony Optimization 173 we present the main ideas and the mathematical background of the statistical analyses based software bug localization approach which has evolved over the past 10 years. IV. APPLICATIONS OF ANT COLONY OPTIMZATION ACO is used in routing problem i.e. traveling salesman problem, vehicle routing and sequential ordering. 1. It is applied to solve job scheduling problem, project scheduling and applied in multilevel framework also. 2. It is also used to solve many assignment problems like frequency assignment, graph coloring and quadratic assignment problem. 3. ACO is also applied in the field of networking like optical network routing, connection oriented routing etc. 4. It can be used to solve knapsack problem and set covering problems and applied in fuzzy systems. 5. Nearest neighbor node choosing rule can be solved by using ant colony optimization.[2]",

                    "abstract": "Epidemic simulation traditionally serves as one of the important methods to forecast how an epidemic may spread among a population. However, there are two key limitations that restrict the scope of such methods. The first limitation is that the existing tools rely on different sets of static parameters (e.g., infection probability, recovering probability) for simulating an epidemic spread that may fail to capture the dynamic nature of population interactions that acts as a dominant factor in an epidemic spread scenario such as COVID-19 pandemic. To handle this challenge, we propose a machine learning based model that combines a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). It integrates the ability of the GCN to capture spatial dependency in human interaction and the ability of the RNN to incorporate temporal effects of the virus spread. The second limitation is that these methods do not address the computation overhead problem when dealing with time-dynamic graphs. Training a GCN on a very large graph suffers from the communication overhead from different graph partitions and the computation overheads stemming from partitioning dynamic graphs. This limitation impacts the scalability of the existing systems. To solve this challenge, we partition the graph in a computationally less expensive manner by partitioning the graph using the min-cut principle. We conducted comprehensive large scale real-world human mobility data driven experiments. Our experimental result shows that the proposed machine learning based forecasting model achieves overall 84% classification accuracy with greater than 72% precision and 62% recall. Also, the proposed graph partitioning approach reduces computation time and commutation overhead by a significant margin.",

In this study, we applied a continuous Markov-chain model to simulate the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. The results of this study indicate that the herd immunity threshold should be significantly higher than 1 \u2212 1/R0. Taking the immunity waning effect into consideration, the model could predict an epidemic resurgence after the herd immunity threshold. Meanwhile, this Markov-chain approach could also forecast the epidemic distribution and predict the epidemic hotspots at different times. It is implied from our model that it is significantly challenging to eradicate SARS-CoV-2 in the short term. The actual epidemic development is consistent with our prediction. In the end, this method displayed great potential as an alternative approach to traditional compartment models. Abstract To address the urgent need to accurately predict the spreading trend of the COVID-19 epidemic, a continuous Markov-chain model was, for the first time, developed in this work to predict the spread of COVID-19 infection. A probability matrix of infection was first developed in this model based upon the contact frequency of individuals within the population, the individual\u2019s characteristics, and other factors that can effectively reflect the epidemic\u2019s temporal and spatial variation characteristics. The Markov-chain model was then extended to incorporate both the mutation effect of COVID-19 and the decaying effect of antibodies. The developed comprehensive Markov-chain model that integrates the aforementioned factors was finally tested by real data to predict the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic. The result shows that our model can effectively avoid the prediction dilemma that may exist with traditional ordinary differential equations model, such as the susceptible\u2013infectious\u2013recovered (SIR) model. Meanwhile, it can forecast the epidemic distribution and predict the epidemic hotspots geographically at different times. It is also demonstrated in our result that the influence of the population\u2019s spatial and geographic distribution in a herd infection event is needed in the model for a better prediction of the epidemic trend. At the same time, our result indicates that no simple derivative relationship exists between the threshold of herd immunity and the virus basic reproduction number R0. The threshold of herd immunity achieved through natural immunity is significantly higher than 1 \u2212 1/R0. These not only explain the theoretical misconceptions of herd immunity thresholds in herd immunity theory but also provide a guidance for predicting the optimal vaccination coverage. In addition, our model can predict the temporal and spatial distribution of infections in different epidemic waves. It is implied from our model that it is challenging to eradicate COVID-19 in the short term for a large population size and a wide spatial distribution. It is predicted that COVID-19 is likely to coexist with humans for a long time and that it will exhibit multipoint epidemic effects at a later stage. The statistical evidence is consistent with our prediction and strongly supports our modeling results.",

The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Hospitalized-Critical-Deaths (SEIR-HCD) model proposed in this research work is identified as a valuable tool for capturing the complex dynamics of disease transmission, healthcare demands, and mortality rates during epidemics.\n\nBackground: The spread of viral diseases is a major problem for public health services all over the world.

In epidemiology, the SIS, SIR, and SEIR models have been used to mimic and study how diseases spread in groups of people.\n\nMethodology: This research focuses on the integration of air traffic network data into the SEIR-HCD model to enhance the understanding of disease spread in air travel settings. By incorporating air traffic data, the model considers the role of travel patterns and connectivity in disease dissemination, enabling the identification of high-risk routes, airports, and regions.\n\nContribution: This research contributes to the field of epidemiology by enhancing our understanding of disease spread dynamics through the application of the SIS, SIR, and SEIR-HCD models. The findings provide insights into the factors influencing disease transmission, allowing for the development of effective strategies for disease control and prevention.\n\nFindings: The interplay between local outbreaks and global disease dissemination through air travel is empirically explored.

                    "abstract": "The detection of an epidemic source or the patient zero is an important practical problem that can help in developing the epidemic control strategies. In this paper, we study the statistical inference problem of detecting the source of epidemics from a snapshot of a contagion spreading process at some time on an arbitrary network structure. By using exact analytic calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate the detectability limits for the SIR model, which primarily depend on the spreading process characteristics. We introduce an efficient Bayesian Monte Carlo source probability estimator and compare its performance against state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the approach in a realistic setting of an epidemic spreading over an empirical temporal network of sexual interactions. Introduction The majority of biological, technological, social and information systems structures can be represented as a complex network [1, 2, 3]. The most prevalent type of dynamic processes of public interest characteristic for the real-life complex networks are contagion processes [4]. Different mathematical methods have been used to study the epidemic spreading on complex networks including the bond percolation method [7, 8], the mean-field approach [9, 10], the reaction-diffusion processes [11, 12], pair and the master equation approximations [13] as well as models with the complex compartmental structure along with population mobility dynamics [14]. Epidemiologists detect the epidemic source or the patient-zero either by analysing the temporal genetic evolution of virus strains [5] or try to do a contact backtracking [6] from the available observed data. However, in cases where the information on the times of contact is unknown, or incomplete, the backtracking method is no longer adequate. This 1 ar X iv :1 40 6. 29 09 v1 [ cs .S I] 1 1 Ju n 20 14 becomes especially hard if the only data available is a static snapshot of a epidemic process at some time. Even in cases when we do have some information on the times of contact, the longer the recovery time and subtler the symptoms the harder it becomes to establish the proper ordering of the transmissions that have occurred. Due to its practical aspects and theoretical importance, the epidemic source detection problem on contact networks has recently gained a lot of attention in complex network science community. This has led to the development of many different source detection estimators for static networks, which vary in their assumptions on the network structure and the spreading process models [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. For the source detection with the SI model the following interesting results have been obtained. Zaman et. al. developed a rumor centrality measure, which is the maximum likelihood estimator for regular trees under the SI model [15]. Dong et. al. also studied the problem of rooting the rumor source with the SI model and demonstrated the asymptotic source detection probability on regular tree-type networks [16]. Comin et. al. compared the different centrality measures e.g. the degree, the betweenness, the closeness and the eigenvector centrality as the source detection estimators [22]. Wang et. al. addressed the problem of source estimation from multiple observations under the SI model [17]. Pinto et. al. used the SI model and assumed that the direction and the times of the infection are known exactly, and solved diffusion tree problem using breadth first search from sparsely placed observers [19]. In the case of the SIR model there are two different approaches. Zhu et. al. adopted the SIR model and proposed a sample path counting approach for the source detection [18]. They proved that the source node on infinite trees minimizes the maximum distance (Jordan centrality) to the infected nodes. Lokhov et. al. used a dynamic message-passing algorithm (DMP) for the SIR model to estimate the probability that a given node produces the observed snapshot. They use a mean-field-like approximation (independence approximation) and an assumption of a tree-like contact network to compute the marginal probabilities [20]. The main contributions of the paper are the following: (i) given the non-uniqueness of finding a single epidemic source of the SIR realization on general networks, we turn the problem to finding a source probability distribution, which is a well-posed problem; (ii) we develop the analytic combinatoric and the direct Monte-Carlo approaches for determining theoretical source probability distribution and produce the benchmark solutions on the 4-connected lattice; (iii) we measure the source detectability by using the normalized Shannon entropy of the estimated source probability distribution for each of the source detection problems and observe the existence of the highly detectable and the highly undetectable regimes; (iv) using the above insights, we construct the Soft Margin epidemic source detection estimator for the arbitrary networks (static and temporal) and show that it is robust and more accurate than the state-ofthe-art approaches and much faster than the analytic combinatoric or the direct Monte-Carlo approach; (v) by using the simulations of the sexually transmitted disease (STD) model on a realistic time interval of 200 days on an empirical temporal network of sexual contacts (see the network visualization in Figure 4, plot C) we demonstrate the robustness to the uncertainty in the epidemic starting time, the network interaction orderings and in incompleteness of observations. Although we use the SIR model of epidemic spreading, our algorithms are easily applicable to other compartmental models, e.g. SI and SEIR and all other compartmental models where the states cannot be recurrent. 1 Detectability limits The main goals of this work are to better understand the nature of the epidemic source detection problem in networks, characterize its complexity, and develop efficient algorithms for estimating source probability distribution. Next, we introduce the terminology and formalize the problem. In a general case, the contactnetwork during an epidemic process can be temporal",

The remainder of the chapter deals with the behavior of these models on networks, where the behavior of spreading diseases depends strongly on network structure. It is shown that the SIR model maps to a bond percolation process on networks, allowing us to solve for static properties such as the total number of individuals infected in a disease outbreak. The case of the configuration model is developed in detail and the calculations are extended to competing diseases, coinfection, and complex contagion. Time-dependent behavior of diseases on networks is also studied using various differential equation approximations, including pair approximations and degree-based approximations.",

The large-scale traffic flow that emerges with the rapid development of global economic integration plays a significant role in the epidemic spread. In order to more accurately indicate the time characteristics of the traffic-driven epidemic spread, new parameters are added to represent the change of the infection rate parameter over time on the traffic-driven Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic spread model. Based on the collected epidemic data in Hebei Province, a linear regression method is performed to estimate the infection rate parameter and an improved traffic-driven SIR epidemic spread dynamics model is established. The impact of different link-closure rules, traffic flow and average degree on the epidemic spread is studied. The maximum instantaneous number of infected nodes and the maximum number of ever infected nodes are obtained through simulation. Compared to the simulation results of the links being closed between large-degree nodes, closing the links between small-degree nodes can effectively inhibit the epidemic spread. In addition, reducing traffic flow and increasing the average degree of the network can also slow the epidemic outbreak.

In particular, the dissemination of negative information can contribute to vaccine hesitancy, thereby exacerbating infectious disease outbreaks. This study investigates strategies to mitigate anti-vaccine social contagion through effective counter-campaigns that disseminate positive vaccine information and encourage vaccine uptake, aiming to reduce the size of epidemics. In a coupled agent-based model that consists of opinion and disease diffusion processes, we explore and compare different heuristics to design positive campaigns based on the network structure and local presence of negative vaccine attitudes. We examine two campaigning regimes: a static regime with a fixed set of targets, and a dynamic regime in which targets can be updated over time. We demonstrate that strategic targeting and engagement with the dynamics of anti-vaccine influence diffusion in the network can effectively mitigate the spread of anti-vaccine sentiment, thereby reducing the epidemic size. However, the effectiveness of the campaigns differs across different targeting strategies and is impacted by a range of factors. We find that the primary advantage of static campaigns lies in their capacity to act as an obstacle, preventing the clustering of emerging anti-vaccine communities, thereby resulting in smaller and unconnected anti-vaccine groups. On the other hand, dynamic campaigns reach a broader segment of the population and adapt to the evolution of anti-vaccine diffusion, not only protecting susceptible agents from negative influence but also fostering positive propagation within negative regions.",

This study explores the dynamics of coupled awareness and biological infection spread within a two-layer multiplex network framework. One layer embodies face-to-face contacts, with a biological infection transmission following a simple contagion model, the SIR process. Awareness, modelled by the linear threshold model, a complex contagion, spreads over a social layer and induces behaviour that lowers the chance of a biological infection occurring. It may be provoked by the presence of either aware or infectious neighbours. We introduce a novel model combining these influences through a convex combination, creating a continuum between pure social contagion and local risk perception. Simulation of the model shows distinct effects arising from the awareness sources. Also, for convex combinations where both input sources are of importance, awareness cascades that are not attributable to only one of these sources, emerge. Here, the combination of a small-world face-to-face and a scale-free social layer, but not vice versa, cause the number of infections to decrease with increasing transmission probability.",

For example, the aware individuals migrate away from areas with severe infection. In this paper, we study the coupling transmission of epidemic and information in metapopulation networks, and mainly explore how the change of individual migration behavior affects the epidemic spreading. Combined with the transition probability tree of individual states, we use Markov chain approach for theoretical analysis and derive the epidemic threshold. Through numerous Monte Carlo simulation, we verify the accuracy of Markov equations for the prediction of epidemic sprading. The results show that the role of information transmission in suppressing the epidemic in terms of the epidemic threshold and the infection scale is very limited. Further increase of information transmission rate beyond its critical value will no longer affect the epidemic. The initial population distribution is a fundamental factor in the epidemic dynamics, and in the case of heterogeneous distribution, an appropriate movement of individuals can delay the epidemic spread with a smaller threshold. In addition, topological homogeneity of individual migration route is beneficial for the epidemic control. This study analyzes the interaction between epidemic and information on the metapopulation network model, which can provide guidance for epidemic intervention in reality.",

Recent studies have widely considered the metapopulation model, where epidemics spread over a single layer of physical networks via individual mobility. However, these advances neglected the interventions of accompanied information and individual behavior response related to epidemics. In this article, we develop a coupled epidemic-information propagation model on multiplex metapopulation networks leveraging the microscopic Markov chain (MMC) approach, aiming to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of epidemic spreading process. Taking the individual adaptive behavior into account, the stranding mechanism based on infection level and medical resources is introduced to capture the population size dynamics during individual mobility among different patches. Theoretical epidemic threshold is analytically derived under the improved framework. Extensive numerical simulations are performed to validate our theoretical analysis and further examine the impacts of information propagation and spreading parameters on epidemic threshold and steady-state prevalence. Our results indicate that both the scale of information diffusion and the specific configuration of spreading parameters can significantly suppress the epidemic prevalence. These findings shed a novel light on theoretical research and decision-making of coupled epidemic-information process in the spatiotemporal perspective.",

This is relevant when, for example, the number of arriving infected individuals is large, but also to the modeling of a large number of infected individuals, but also to more general situations such as the spread of ideas in the presence of publicity campaigns. This model is frequently studied by mapping to a bond percolation problem, in which edges in the network are occupied with the probability, p, of eventual infection along an edge connecting an infected individual to a susceptible neighbor. This approach allows one to calculate the total final size of the infection and epidemic threshold in the limit of a vanishingly small seed fraction. We show, however, that when the initial infection occupies a nonvanishing fraction f of the network, this method yields ambiguous results, as the correspondence between edge occupation and contagion transmission no longer holds. We propose instead to measure the giant component of recovered individuals within the original contact network. This has an unambiguous interpretation and correctly captures the dependence of the epidemic size on f . We give exact equations for the size of the epidemic and the epidemic threshold in the infinite size limit. We observe a second order phase transition as in the original formulation, however with an epidemic threshold which decreases with increasing f .

                    "abstract": "The detection of an epidemic source or the patient zero is an important practical problem that can help in developing the epidemic control strategies. In this paper, we study the statistical inference problem of detecting the source of epidemics from a snapshot of a contagion spreading process at some time on an arbitrary network structure. By using exact analytic calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate the detectability limits for the SIR model, which primarily depend on the spreading process characteristics. We introduce an efficient Bayesian Monte Carlo source probability estimator and compare its performance against state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the approach in a realistic setting of an epidemic spreading over an empirical temporal network of sexual interactions. Introduction The majority of biological, technological, social and information systems structures can be represented as a complex network [1, 2, 3]. The most prevalent type of dynamic processes of public interest characteristic for the real-life complex networks are contagion processes [4]. Different mathematical methods have been used to study the epidemic spreading on complex networks including the bond percolation method [7, 8], the mean-field approach [9, 10], the reaction-diffusion processes [11, 12], pair and the master equation approximations [13] as well as models with the complex compartmental structure along with population mobility dynamics [14]. Epidemiologists detect the epidemic source or the patient-zero either by analysing the temporal genetic evolution of virus strains [5] or try to do a contact backtracking [6] from the available observed data. However, in cases where the information on the times of contact is unknown, or incomplete, the backtracking method is no longer adequate. This 1 ar X iv :1 40 6. 29 09 v1 [ cs .S I] 1 1 Ju n 20 14 becomes especially hard if the only data available is a static snapshot of a epidemic process at some time. Even in cases when we do have some information on the times of contact, the longer the recovery time and subtler the symptoms the harder it becomes to establish the proper ordering of the transmissions that have occurred. Due to its practical aspects and theoretical importance, the epidemic source detection problem on contact networks has recently gained a lot of attention in complex network science community. This has led to the development of many different source detection estimators for static networks, which vary in their assumptions on the network structure and the spreading process models [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. For the source detection with the SI model the following interesting results have been obtained. Zaman et. al. developed a rumor centrality measure, which is the maximum likelihood estimator for regular trees under the SI model [15]. Dong et. al. also studied the problem of rooting the rumor source with the SI model and demonstrated the asymptotic source detection probability on regular tree-type networks [16]. Comin et. al. compared the different centrality measures e.g. the degree, the betweenness, the closeness and the eigenvector centrality as the source detection estimators [22]. Wang et. al. addressed the problem of source estimation from multiple observations under the SI model [17]. Pinto et. al. used the SI model and assumed that the direction and the times of the infection are known exactly, and solved diffusion tree problem using breadth first search from sparsely placed observers [19]. In the case of the SIR model there are two different approaches. Zhu et. al. adopted the SIR model and proposed a sample path counting approach for the source detection [18]. They proved that the source node on infinite trees minimizes the maximum distance (Jordan centrality) to the infected nodes. Lokhov et. al. used a dynamic message-passing algorithm (DMP) for the SIR model to estimate the probability that a given node produces the observed snapshot. They use a mean-field-like approximation (independence approximation) and an assumption of a tree-like contact network to compute the marginal probabilities [20]. The main contributions of the paper are the following: (i) given the non-uniqueness of finding a single epidemic source of the SIR realization on general networks, we turn the problem to finding a source probability distribution, which is a well-posed problem; (ii) we develop the analytic combinatoric and the direct Monte-Carlo approaches for determining theoretical source probability distribution and produce the benchmark solutions on the 4-connected lattice; (iii) we measure the source detectability by using the normalized Shannon entropy of the estimated source probability distribution for each of the source detection problems and observe the existence of the highly detectable and the highly undetectable regimes; (iv) using the above insights, we construct the Soft Margin epidemic source detection estimator for the arbitrary networks (static and temporal) and show that it is robust and more accurate than the state-ofthe-art approaches and much faster than the analytic combinatoric or the direct Monte-Carlo approach; (v) by using the simulations of the sexually transmitted disease (STD) model on a realistic time interval of 200 days on an empirical temporal network of sexual contacts (see the network visualization in Figure 4, plot C) we demonstrate the robustness to the uncertainty in the epidemic starting time, the network interaction orderings and in incompleteness of observations. Although we use the SIR model of epidemic spreading, our algorithms are easily applicable to other compartmental models, e.g. SI and SEIR and all other compartmental models where the states cannot be recurrent. 1 Detectability limits The main goals of this work are to better understand the nature of the epidemic source detection problem in networks, characterize its complexity, and develop efficient algorithms for estimating source probability distribution. Next, we introduce the terminology and formalize the problem. In a general case, the contactnetwork during an epidemic process can be temporal",

                    "abstract": "Researchers often use theoretical models which provide a relatively sim- ple, yet concise and effective way of modelling various phenomena. However, it is a well-known fact that the more complex the model, the more complex the mathematical description is. For this reason, theoretical models generally avoid large complexity and aim for the simplest possible definition, which although makes models mathematically more manageable, in practice it also often leads to sub-optimal performance. Furthermore, the data collected during the observations usually contain confounding factors, for which a simple theoretical model can not be prepared. Overall, mathematical models are usually too rigid and sophisticated, and therefore cannot really deal with sudden changes in the environment. The application of artificial intelligence, however, provides a good opportunity to develop complex models that can combine the basic capabilities of the theoretical models with the ability to learn more complex relationships. It has been shown [16] that with neural networks, we can build such models that can approximate mathematical functions. Trained artificial neural networks are thus able to behave like theoretical models developed for different fields, while still retaining their overall flexibility, which guarantees an overall better performance in a complex realworld environment. The aim of our study is to show our notion that we can create an architecture using neural networks, which is able to approximate a given theoretical model, and then further improve it with the help of real data to suit the real world and its various aspects better. In order to validate the functionality of the architecture developed by us, we have selected a simple theoretical model, namely the Kermack-McKendrick one [4] as the base of our research. This is an SIR [2] model, which is a relatively simple compartmental epidemic model, based on differential equations that can be used well for infections that spread very similarly to influenza or COVID. However, on one hand, the SIR model relies too heavily on its parameters, with slight changes in them leading to drastic overall changes of the S, I and R curves, and on the other hand, the simplicity of the SIR model distorts its accuracy in many cases. In our paper, by using the SIR model, we will show that the architecture described above can be a valid approach to modeling the spread of a given disease (such as influenza or COVID-19). To this end, we detail the accuracy of our models with different settings and configurations and show that it performs better than both a simple mathematical model and a plain neural network with randomly initialized weights.",

                    "abstract": "Objective To develop a spatially accurate biosurveillance synthetic data generator for the testing, evaluation, and comparison of new outbreak detection techniques. Introduction Development of new methods for the rapid detection of emerging disease outbreaks is a research priority in the field of biosurveillance. Because real-world data are often proprietary in nature, scientists must utilize synthetic data generation methods to evaluate new detection methodologies. Colizza et. al. have shown that epidemic spread is dependent on the airline transportation network [1], yet current data generators do not operate over network structures. Here we present a new spatial data generator that models the spread of contagion across a network of cities connected by airline routes. The generator is developed in the R programming language and produces data compatible with the popular `surveillance\u2019 software package. Methods Colizza et. al. demonstrate the power-law relationships between city population, air traffic, and degree distribution [1]. We generate a transportation network as a Chung-Lu random graph [2] that preserves these scale-free relationships (Figure 1). First, given a power-law exponent and a desired number of cities, a probability mass function (PMF) is generated that mirrors the expected degree distribution for the given power-law relationship. Values are then sampled from this PMF to generate an expected degree (number of connected cities) for each city in the network. Edges (airline connections) are added to the network probabilistically as described in [2]. Unconnected graph components are each joined to the largest component using linear preferential attachment. Finally, city sizes are calculated based on an observed three-quarter power- law scaling relationship with the sampled degree distribution. Each city is represented as a customizable stochastic compartmental SIR model. Transportation between cities is modeled similar to [2]. An infection is initialized in a single random city and infection counts are recorded in each city for a fixed period of time. A consistent fraction of the modeled infection cases are recorded as daily clinic visits. These counts are then added onto statically generated baseline data for each city to produce a full synthetic data set. Alternatively, data sets can be generated using real-world networks, such as the one maintained by the International Air Transport Association. Results Dynamics such as the number of cities, degree distribution power- law exponent, traffic flow, and disease kinetics can be customized. In the presented example (Figure 2) the outbreak spreads over a 20 city transportation network. Infection spreads rapidly once the more populated hub cities are infected. Cities that are multiple flights away from the initially infected city are infected late in the process. The generator is capable of creating data sets of arbitrary size, length, and connectivity to better mirror a diverse set of observed network types. Conclusions New computational methods for outbreak detection and surveillance must be compared to established approaches. Outbreak mitigation strategies require a realistic model of human transportation behavior to best evaluate impact. These actions require test data that accurately reflect the complexity of the real-world data they would be applied to. The outbreak data generated here represents the complexity of modern transportation networks and are made to be easily integrated with established software packages to allow for rapid testing and deployment. Randomly generated scale-free transportation network with a power-law degree exponent of \u03bb =1.8. City and link sizes are scaled to reflect their weight. An example of observed daily outbreak-related clinic visits across a randomly generated network of 20 cities. Each city is colored by the number of flights required to reach the city from the initial infection location. These generated counts are then added onto baseline data to create a synthetic data set for experimentation. Keywords Simulation; Network; Spatial; Synthetic; Data",

The recently proposed Expected Force of Infection (ExF) measures the entropy of all potential transmission paths starting at a node, effectively characterizing a node's role in epidemic diffusion processes. However, this promising metric has seen limited adoption mainly due to an inefficient formulation and the lack of an open-source implementation. In this paper, we present a novel cluster-centric, parallel algorithm enhancing ExF's efficiency and scalability. Compared to the simple parallel version of the original formulation of the ExF our efficient, open-source GPU implementation enables key nodes detection at previously intractable scales, with speed-ups of up to 300 x on networks with up to 44 million edges. Leveraging on our algorithm, we compare the ExF with other well-known centrality metrics, upon six real and synthetic contact networks. The ExF emerges as the best of the considered metrics in a few, important tasks: it predicts the likelihood of a global epidemic and its diffusion speed, based on the centrality of the seed node; and it predicts how many other infections will occur as a consequence, in some sense, of a specific node having caught the disease.",

The conventional computational epidemic models provide a state-space representation of the dynamic changes of various sub-clusters of a society based on their exposure to the virus and are primarily developed for small-size epidemics. In this work, we reformulate the conventional computational epidemic modeling approach inspired by the complex temporal dynamics observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. We utilize the Poisson point process to delineate transitions between various states, enabling us to track the exposed population effectively. The proposed model, based on random event-based Poisson arrivals, offers a comprehensive framework for understanding disease spread when the exposed state is intermediate between susceptibility and infectiousness and delays in implementing mitigation strategies are inevitable. Moreover, our newly proposed framework allows the construction of the transmission probability ($p$) as a probabilistic function of contributing factors such as virus mutation, immunity waning, and immunity resilience. Our results unravel the interplay between delays, transmission probability, vaccination, virus mutation, immunity loss, and their indirect impacts on the endemic states and waves of the spread. The proposed model provides a mathematical framework that allows policy-makers to improve preparedness for curtailing a lingering infectious disease spreading and unfolds the optimal time frame for vaccination given the available resources and the probability of virus mutation for the current and unforeseen outbreaks.",

                    "abstract": "Network-based time series models have experienced a surge in popularity over the past years due to their ability to model temporal and spatial dependencies, arising from the spread of infectious disease. The generalised network autoregressive (GNAR) model conceptualises time series on the vertices of a network; it has an autoregressive component for temporal dependence and a spatial autoregressive component for dependence between neighbouring vertices in the network. Consequently, the choice of underlying network is essential. This paper assesses the performance of GNAR models on different networks in predicting COVID-19 cases for the 26 counties in the Republic of Ireland, over two distinct pandemic phases (restricted and unrestricted), characterised by inter-county movement restrictions. Ten static networks are constructed, in which vertices represent counties, and edges are built upon neighbourhood relations, such as railway lines. We find that a GNAR model based on the fairly sparse Economic hub network explains the data best for the restricted pandemic phase while the fairly dense 21-nearest neighbour network performs best for the unrestricted phase. Across phases, GNAR models have higher predictive accuracy than standard ARIMA models which ignore the network structure. For county-specific predictions, in pandemic phases with more lenient or no COVID-19 regulation, the network effect is not quite as pronounced. The results indicate some robustness to the precise network architecture as long as the densities of the networks are similar. An analysis of the residuals justifies the model assumptions for the restricted phase but raises questions regarding their validity for the unrestricted phase. While generally performing better than ARIMA models which ignore network effects, there is scope for further development of the GNAR model to better model complex infectious diseases, including COVID-19.",

Therefore, modeling human behavior is a precursor to reliable estimates of epidemic size and duration. In this paper, we present an abstract model of fear, which is realized using an Individual-based Fear Model (IBFM). In this model, fear is coupled with contagion to study the influence of human behavior on epidemic dynamics. Since fear is an inherent characteristic of an individual that determines susceptibility to infection, the model discerns between individuals by maintaining a fear-index. Variations in innate fear levels in populations with cultural differences are also accommodated. Since the fear level of individuals is affected by the changing size of the epidemic, IBFM provides a mechanism to update fear in the population realistically. The mechanism gives rise to multiple epidemic waves observed in real-world epidemics. We compare the epidemic dynamics for IBFM and differential equation-based realization of the abstract model. We present a detailed empirical study to understand the interplay of fear and contagion in IBFM.",

The stationary state of spreading dynamics in a population of mobile agents thus depends on the interplay between the time and length scales involved in the epidemic process and their motion in space. We analyze the steady properties resulting from such interplay in a simple model describing epidemic spreading (modeled as a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible process) on self-propelled particles (performing Run-and-Tumble motion). Focusing our attention on the diffusive long-time regime, we find that the agents' motion changes qualitatively the nature of the epidemic transition characterized by the emergence of a macroscopic fraction of infected agents. Indeed, the transition becomes of the mean-field type for agents diffusing in one, two and three dimensions, while, in the absence of motion, the epidemic outbreak depends on the dimension of the underlying static network determined by the agents' fixed locations. The insights obtained from a continuum description of the system are validated by numerical simulations of an agent-based model.

The system is subjected to hygro-thermal environments and both compressive and tensile in-plane loads in both x- and y-direction. In addition to both linear and nonlinear thermal conditions, a two-dimensional (2D) magnetic field\u2019s effects on the stability of the system are studied. The governing equations of motion are solved numerically by means of the generalized differential quadrature method (GDQM) due to its capability to consider the various geometric boundary conditions (BCs). In order to validate the current work, a comparative study is accomplished between the present outcomes and reported ones in the open literature. The impact of the carbon nanotube (CNT) volume fraction, patterns of CNT distribution, environmental attacks, magnetic field strength and direction, structure aspect ratios, BCs, and foundation types on the vibrational behavior of the considered structure are scrutinized. Obtained results represent that considering the impacts of in-plane tensile forces and the magnetic field in modeling improves the system's vibrational behavior. While imposing the hygro-thermal effects similar to the axial compressive loads have destabilizing influences on the system and make the structure more vulnerable to static instability. Moreover, uncertain conditions are assessed for sensitive parameters which have effects on the performance of the system. Finally, using a supervised neural network (NN) learning approach, the accuracy of the model is proved.",

Traditional compartmental models often struggle to estimate temporally and spatially varying epidemiological parameters, while deep learning models typically overlook disease transmission dynamics and lack interpretability in the epidemiological context. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Causal Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (CSTGNN), a hybrid framework that integrates a Spatio-Contact SIR model with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture the spatiotemporal propagation of epidemics. Inter-regional human mobility exhibits continuous and smooth spatiotemporal patterns, leading to adjacent graph structures that share underlying mobility dynamics. To model these dynamics, we employ an adaptive static connectivity graph to represent the stable components of human mobility and utilize a temporal dynamics model to capture fluctuations within these patterns. By integrating the adaptive static connectivity graph with the temporal dynamics graph, we construct a dynamic graph that encapsulates the comprehensive properties of human mobility networks. Additionally, to capture temporal trends and variations in infectious disease spread, we introduce a temporal decomposition model to handle temporal dependence. This model is then integrated with a dynamic graph convolutional network for epidemic forecasting. We validate our model using real-world datasets at the provincial level in China and the state level in Germany. Extensive studies demonstrate that our method effectively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious diseases, providing a valuable tool for forecasting and intervention strategies. Furthermore, analysis of the learned parameters offers insights into disease transmission mechanisms, enhancing the interpretability and practical applicability of our model.",

These properties are described by parameterized inequalities. However, enforcing these inequalities globally can lead to very large parameters, resulting in overly conservative observer design criteria. These criteria become infeasible for highly nonlinear applications, such as networked epidemic processes. In this paper, we present an observer design approach for estimating the state of nonlinear systems, without requiring any parameterization of the system's nonlinearities. The proposed observer design depends only on systems' matrices and applies to systems with any nonlinearity. We establish different design criteria for ensuring both asymptotic and exponential convergence of the estimation error to zero. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we employ it for estimating the state of a networked SIR epidemic model. We show that, even in the presence of measurement noise, the observer can accurately estimate the epidemic state of each node in the network.

The extent of these bifurcations is modulated by the graph heterogeneity, the recovery parameter, and the network size. In the limit of large, well-mixed networks, the behavior approaches that of difference equation models, suggesting this behavior is a universal feature of all discrete-time SIR models.

Although it has long been known that such processes take place on social networks, the assumption of \u2018random mixing\u2019 is usually made, which ignores network structure. However, \u2018super-spreading events\u2019 have been found to be power-law distributed, suggesting that the underlying networks may be scale free or at least highly heterogeneous. The random-mixing assumption would then produce an overestimation of the herd-immunity threshold for given R 0; and a (more significant) overestimation of R 0 itself. These two errors compound each other, and can lead to forecasts greatly overestimating the number of infections. Moreover, if networks are heterogeneous and change in time, multiple waves of infection can occur, which are not predicted by random mixing. A simple SIR model simulated on both Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi and scale-free networks shows that details of the network structure can be more important than the intrinsic transmissibility of a disease. It is therefore crucial to incorporate network information into standard models of epidemics.",

This paper investigates the effect of the structure of the contact network on the dynamics of the epidemic outbreak. In particular we focus on the peak number of critically infected nodes, because this determines the workload of intensive health-care units and should be kept low when managing an epidemic. Simulation of virus propagation in complex networks of different topologies, generated according to the models of Erd\u0151s\u2014R\u00e9nyi, Watts-Strogatz, Barab\u00e1si\u2014Albert and in complete graph. Continuous-time Markov chains were used to simulate the infection process. The simulation was performed in networks with 200 nodes and different number of edges. The difference between the influence of age- and gender-determined and weighted characteristics of nodes on the number of critically infected nodes that can be used to predict the load on the hospital is analyzed. The analysis used the data of the demographic distribution of Ukraine as of 2020 and data on mortality from COVID-19 in Ukraine, as of December 16, 2020. It is proved that the deterministic characteristics a slightly lower values of critically infected, in small networks. According to the simulation results, it was proven that for one medium degree of connection, the largest peak number of infections is observed in the Barab\u00e1si\u2014Albert models, slightly less in the Erd\u0151s\u2014 R\u00e9nyi models and the smallest in the Watts-Strogatz model. It is established that the main difference between these networks is the average shortest distance. It is proved that the main influence on the propagation rate has the average shortest distance between network nodes, location, clustering coefficient has less influence. It was found that with a large number of edges in the networks, the difference in the prevalence of viruses in the models of the Erd\u0151s\u2014R\u00e9nyi and Barab\u00e1si\u2014Albert networks is minimized, despite the reduction of the average shortest distance between nodes.",

It is known that the structure of the human contact network plays an important role in the spread of transmissible diseases. In this work, we study a structure aware model of COVID-19 CGEM. This model becomes similar to the classical compartment-based models in epidemiology if we assume the contact network is a Erdos-Renyi (ER) graph, i.e. everyone comes into contact with everyone else with the same probability. In contrast, CGEM is more expressive and allows for plugging in the actual contact networks, or more realistic proxies for it. Moreover, CGEM enables more precise modelling of enforcing and releasing different non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies. Through a set of extensive experiments, we demonstrate significant differences between the epidemic curves when assuming different underlying structures. More specifically we demonstrate that the compartment-based models are overestimating the spread of the infection by a factor of 3, and under some realistic assumptions on the compliance factor, underestimating the effectiveness of some of NPIs, mischaracterizing others (e.g. predicting a later peak), and underestimating the scale of the second peak after reopening.",

The aim of this research is to provide a high-resolution global model of the pandemic that overcomes the problem of biased country-level data on the number of infected cases. To achieve this we propose a novel SIR-type metapopulation transmission model and a set of analytically derived model parameters. We used them to perform a simulation of the disease spread with help of the Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEAM) framework embedding actual population densities, commute patterns and long-range travel networks. The simulation starts on 17 November 2019 with the index case (presymptomatic, yet infectious) in Wuhan, China, and results in an accurate prediction of the number of diagnosed cases after 154 days in multiple countries across five continents. In addition, the model outcome shows high compliance with the results of a random screening test conducted on pregnant women in the New York area. Methods We have built a modified SIR metapopulation transmission model and parameterized it analytically either by setting the values of the parameters based on the literature, or by assuming their plausible values. We compared our results with the number of diagnosed cases in twenty selected countries, ones which provide reliable statistics but differ substantially in terms of strength and speed of undertaken Non-Drug Interventions. The obtained 95% confidence intervals for the predictions are in agreement with the empirical data. Results The parameters that successfully model the pandemic are: the basic reproduction number R0, 4.4; a latent non-infectious period of 1.1. days followed by 4.6 days of the presymptomatic infectious period; the probability of developing severe symptoms, 0.01; the probability of being diagnosed when presenting severe symptoms of 0.6; the probability of diagnosis for cases with mild symptoms or asymptomatic, 0.001. Discussion Parameters that successfully reproduce the observed number of cases indicate that both R0 and the prevalence of the virus might be underestimated. This is in concordance with the newest research on undocumented COVID-19 cases. Consequently, the actual mortality rate is putatively lower than estimated. Confirmation of the pandemic characteristic by further refinement of the model and screening tests is crucial for developing an effective strategy for the global epidemiological crisis.",

In this study, we provide an analysis of epidemic dynamics using three well-known stochastic network models\u2014small-world networks (Watts\u2013Strogatz), random networks (Erd\u00f6s\u2013R\u00e9nyi), and scale-free networks (Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert)\u2014to assess the impact of different viral strains, lockdown strategies, and vaccination campaigns. We highlight the significant role of highly connected nodes in the spread of infections, particularly within Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert networks. These networks experienced earlier and higher peaks in infection rates, but ultimately had the lowest total number of infections, indicating their rapid transmission dynamics. We also found that intermittent lockdown strategies, particularly those with 7-day intervals, effectively reduce the total number of infections, serving as viable alternatives to prolonged continuous lockdowns. When simulating vaccination campaigns, we observed a bimodal distribution leading to two distinct outcomes: pandemic contraction and pandemic expansion. For WS and ER networks, rapid mass vaccination campaigns significantly reduced infection rates compared to slower campaigns; however, for BA networks, differences between vaccination strategies were minimal. To account for the evolution of a virus into a more transmissible strain, we modeled vaccination scenarios that varied vaccine efficacy against the wild-type virus and noted a decline in this efficacy over time against a second variant. Our results showed that vaccination coverage above 40% significantly flattened infection peaks for the wild-type virus, while at least 80% coverage was required to similarly reduce peaks for variant 2. Furthermore, the effect of vaccine efficacy on reducing the peak of variant 2 infection was minimal. Although vaccination strategies targeting hub nodes in scale-free networks did not substantially reduce the total number of infections, they were effective in increasing the probability of preventing pandemic outbreaks. These findings underscore the need to consider the network structure for effective pandemic control.",

The authors claim that they observe a \u201ca hitherto unobserved transition from linear growth to S-shaped infection curves.\u201d This is rather surprising in the context of previous literature studying similar models (3\u20139). While scale-free networks (10) were reported to give rise to nonstandard features, including the absence of a nontrivial epidemic threshold and an algebraic spreading growth (6\u20138), no such abnormalities were observed on small-world networks (3\u20135, 7). Indeed, in the following, we show that the analysis presented in the paper (1) is flawed. The problem lies in the order parameter O= SD\u00f0C\u00f0t\u00de\u00de, the standard deviation of new daily cases (excluding days with no new cases), which is used to signal the postulated transition between an S-shaped growth (O> 0) and a linear growth (O\u2248 0). In reality, O can attain values close to zero for two distinct reasons: 1) C\u00f0t\u00de is constant (corresponding to a linear growth of the cumulative number of cases) as the authors claim, or 2) C\u00f0t\u00de exhibits low values, signaling that the epidemic is not able to effectively spread in the population and the number of cases drops exponentially, corresponding to the basic reproduction number R0 taking a value below one. Case 2, which is in line with the prediction of the classical SIR model, was never considered in ref. 1; both theoretical and numerical calculations established the existence of a critical point, but no evidence was reported for the existence of the postulated linear growth phase below the critical point. We hypothesized that case 2 is the mechanism yielding O\u2248 0 below the critical point. To test this, we independently simulated the model introduced in ref. 1. First, we verified that O signals a continuous transition between two distinct phases (Fig. 1A). Second, we calculated the basic reproduction number R0 (Fig. 1B), which confirmed that, below the critical point, an infection does not spread through the network, consistent with case 2. Third, we calculated the outbreak duration Tend, which exhibits a sharp maximum at the critical point and drops especially quickly below the critical point (Fig. 1C). Because Tend upperbounds the possible duration of a linear growth, this result indicates that prolonged linear growth is impossible even slightly below the critical point. Last, we compared the evolution of the cumulative number of infections obtained from the small-world model and the classical SIR model (Fig. 1D). Already slightly below the critical point, the growth curve of the network model is significantly sublinear, as expected from the classical picture. In conclusion, the presented results corroborate our supposition that the linear growth in the cumulative number of infections is restricted to the vicinity of the critical point. Furthermore, we checked that the results are very similar on Erd} os\u2013R\u00e9nyi networks (Fig. 2). Thus, the model introduced in ref. 1 does not predict that nor explain why \u201cmost COVID-19 infection curves are linear.\u201d",

As usual, the SIR model is a stochastic model for an epidemic where infected vertices infect susceptible neighbors at some rate $\\eta$ and recover at rate $\\gamma$, and the SBM is a random graph model where vertices are partitioned into a finite number of communities. The connection probability between two vertices depends on their community affiliation, here scaled so that the average degrees have a finite limit as the network grows. We prove laws of large numbers (LLN) for the epidemic's trajectory to a system of ordinary differential equations over any time horizon (finite or infinite), including in particular a LLN for the final size of the infection. Our proofs rely on two main ingredients: (i) a new coupling of the SIR epidemic and the randomness of the SBM, revealing a vector-valued random variable that drives the epidemic (related to what is usually called the ``force of the infection'' via a linear transformation), and (ii) a novel technique for analyzing the limiting behavior of the infinite time horizon for the infection, using the fact that once the infection passes the herd immunity threshold it dies out quickly and has a negligible impact on the overall size of the infection.",

As such, the corresponding mathematical models and their simulations are central tools to guide political decision-making. Typically, ODE-based models are considered, in which fractions of infected and healthy individuals change deterministically and continuously over time. In this work, we translate an ODE-based COVID-19 spreading model from literature to a stochastic multi-agent system and use a contact network to mimic complex interaction structures. We observe a large dependency of the epidemic's dynamics on the structure of the underlying contact graph, which is not adequately captured by existing ODE-models. For instance, existence of super-spreaders leads to a higher infection peak but a lower death toll compared to interaction structures without super-spreaders. Overall, we observe that the interaction structure has a crucial impact on the spreading dynamics, which exceeds the effects of other parameters such as the basic reproduction number R0. We conclude that deterministic models fitted to COVID-19 outbreak data have limited predictive power or may even lead to wrong conclusions while stochastic models taking interaction structure into account offer different and probably more realistic epidemiological insights.",

In recent years, several machine learning\u2013based RNA\u2013disease association prediction techniques have emerged. However, they primarily focus on modeling relationships of a single type, overlooking the importance of gaining insights into molecular behaviors from a complete regulatory network perspective and discovering biomarkers of unknown types. Furthermore, effectively handling local and global topological structural information of nodes in biological molecular regulatory graphs remains a challenge to improving biomarker prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose a multichannel graph neural network based on multisimilarity modality hypergraph contrastive learning (MML-MGNN) for predicting unknown types of cancer biomarkers. MML-MGNN leverages multisimilarity modality hypergraph contrastive learning to delve into local associations in the regulatory network, learning diverse insights into the topological structures of multiple types of similarities, and then globally modeling the multisimilarity modalities through a multichannel graph autoencoder. By combining representations obtained from local-level associations and global-level regulatory graphs, MML-MGNN can acquire molecular feature descriptors benefiting from multitype association properties and the complete regulatory network. Experimental results on predicting three different types of cancer biomarkers demonstrate the outstanding performance of MML-MGNN. Furthermore, a case study on gastric cancer underscores the outstanding ability of MML-MGNN to gain deeper insights into molecular mechanisms in regulatory networks and prominent potential in cancer biomarker prediction.",

Uncovering the population structure of the HIV-1 epidemic in Botswana will help optimise public health interventions and may identify hidden sub-epidemics. We sought to determine the phylodynamic structure of the Botswana HIV-1 epidemic from viral sequence genetic data. Methods The Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP) randomly sampled 20% of households in 30 villages in Botswana between 2013\u20132018 and tested for HIV-1. Extensive demographic data were collected from all participants and next-generation full-genome HIV-1 sequences were generated from HIV-1 positive participants (n = 4,164), 78% of whom were on antiretroviral treatment (ART). We inferred the stage of infection (< or > 1 year) among HIV-1 cases based on nucleotide diversity and clinical data using a previously trained machine learning model. We then reconstructed time-resolved gag and pol phylogenies from sequences, other Botswana cohorts and publicly available sequences that were genetically close to those from Botswana. We statistically explored phylogenies for partitions with diverging patterns of coalescence, indicating sub-epidemics, and estimated viral effective population size through time, a measure of viral incidence, for each partition. Finally, we compared the demographic makeup, clinical and geographic characteristics across partitions using \u03c72, ANOVA tests and Tukey analysis. Results We identified three partitions of time-resolved gag and pol phylogenies, revealing divergent patterns of coalescence and HIV-1 transmission. In both gag and pol phylogenies, partitions with persistent growth and transmission were characterised by lower treatment coverage and more recent infections when compared to other partitions. The Southern and South East regions of Botswana were over-represented in the fast-growing partitions. Conclusion Our findings suggest that transmission is slowing in segments of the population that have high ART coverage. However, recent infections are over-represented in ongoing sub-epidemics. The phylodynamic structure suggests that there are districts with higher growth and prioritising these in the deployment of public health interventions might curb new infections. Nonetheless the high mobility of Botswana residents should be taken into consideration in implementing effective interventions to combat HIV-1.",

Specifically, we applied a time-series model on each grid cell for its runoff production. The output of each grid cell is then aggregated by a GNN as the final runoff at the watershed outlet. The case study shows that our GNN based model successfully represents the spatial information in predictions. NRM-Graph network has shown less over-fitting and a significant improvement on the model performance compared to the baselines with spatial information. Our research further confirms the importance of spatially distributed hydrological information in rainfall-runoff modeling using deep learning, and we encourage researchers to incorporate more domain knowledge in modeling.",

In recent years, deep learning based methods are emerging for load forecasting because their strong nonlinear approximation capabilities can provide more forecasting precision than conventional statistical methods.

In order to address these problems, an unshared convolution based deep learning model with densely connected network is proposed. In this model, the backbone is the unshared convolutional neural network and a densely connected structure is adopted, which could alleviate the gradient vanishment. What is more, we use a regularization method named clipped $L_2$-norm to overcome over-fitting, and design a trend decomposition strategy to address the possible distribution differences between the training and validation data. Finally, we conduct five case studies to verify the outperformance of our proposed deep learning model for deterministic and interval load forecasting. Two high-voltage and an medium-voltage real load datasets from Australia, Germany and America are used for model training and validation, respectively.

Vaccination is one of the most well-established and effective strategies in order to contain an epidemic. In the present study, we investigate a network-based virus-spreading model building on the popular SIR model. Furthermore, we examine the efficacy of various vaccination strategies in preventing the spread of infectious diseases and maximizing the survival ratio. The experimented strategies exploit a wide range of approaches such as relying on network structure centrality measures, focusing on disease-spreading parameters, and a combination of both. Our proposed hybrid algorithm, which combines network centrality and illness factors, is found to perform better than previous strategies in terms of lowering the final death ratio in the community on various real-world networks and synthetic graph models. Our findings particularly emphasize the significance of taking both network structure properties and disease characteristics into account when devising effective vaccination strategies.",

One of the key assumptions of ADNs is the lack of preferential connections among individuals. This assumption hinders the application of ADNs to several realistic scenarios where some contacts persist in time, rather than intermittently activate. Here, we examine an improved modeling framework that superimposes an ADN to a static backbone network, toward the integration of persistent contacts with time-varying connections. To demonstrate the interplay between the ADN and the static backbone, we investigate the effect of behavioral changes on the disease dynamics. In this framework, each individual may adapt his/her activity as a function of the health status, thereby adjusting the relative weight of time-varying versus static links. To illustrate the approach, we consider two classes of backbone networks, Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi and random regular, and two disease models, SIS and SIR.

The purpose of these models has been to determine the conditions under which a virus becomes rapidly extinct in a network. The most common models of virus propagation in networks are SIS-type models or their variants. In such models, the conditions that lead to a rapid extinction of the spread of a computer virus have been calculated and its dependence on some parameters inherent to the mathematical model has been observed. In this article, we will try to analyze a particular SIS-type model proposed in the past by Chakrabarti as well as an SIRS-type variation of this model proposed in the past by myself. I will show through simulations the influence that the topology of a network has on the dynamics of the spread of a virus in different network types. In the recent past, there have been interesting articles that demonstrate the relationship between the eigenvalue \u03bb1 of the adjacency matrix and the reduction in the spread of a virus in a network. From this, the minimization of the spectral radius strategies by edge suppression has been proposed. This problem is NP-complete in its general case and for this reason, heuristic algorithms have been proposed. In this article, I will perform simulations of an SIS-type model in topologies with the same number of nodes but with different structures to compare their epidemic behavior. The simulations will show that regular topologies with small node degrees, i.e., of degree 4, as is the case of the topology that I call Lattice4, have favorable behavior in terms of the fast extinction property, with respect to other denser and less regular topologies such as the binomial topologies as well as Power law topologies. Based on the results of the simulations, my contribution will consist of proposing, as a node isolation strategy, a transformation of the original topology into an approximately regular topology by edge elimination. Although such a transformed topology is not optimal in terms of reducing the propagation of a virus, it induces the rapid extinction of the virus in the network.",

A SIS propagation model based on reaction process strategy in a universal scale-free hypernetwork is constructed, and the theoretical and simulation analysis of the model is carried out. Using mean field theory, the analytical expressions between infection density and hypernetwork structure parameters as well as propagation parameters in steady state are given. Through individual-based simulation, the theoretical results are verified and the infectious disease spread process under the structure of the hypernetwork and simple scale-free network is compared and analyzed. It becomes apparent that infectious diseases are easier to spread on the hypernetworks, showing the clear clustering characteristics of epidemic spread. Furthermore, the influence of the hypernetwork structure and model parameters on the propagation process is studied. The results of this paper are helpful in further studying the propagation dynamics on the hypernetworks.

A non-monotonic dependence of the epidemic threshold on D with an optimum diffusion rate D \u2217 , for which the epidemic spreading is more efficient, is found for standard diffusion while monotonic decays are observed in the biased case.

This occurs because each individual possesses certain physical defenses and immune capabilities at the time of exposure to the virus. Repeated exposure to the virus can lead to a decline in immune competence, consequently resulting in epidemic infection. The susceptibility of individuals to an epidemic is heterogeneous. We model this characteristic as the individual heterogeneous infection threshold. Then, we propose an individual logarithmic-like infection threshold function on a single-layer complex network to reflect the heterogeneity of individual susceptibility on infecting the virus and the associated epidemic. Next, we introduce a partition theory based on the edge and logarithmic-like infection threshold function to qualitatively analyze the mechanisms of virus infection and epidemic spreading. Finally, simulation results on Erd\u0151\u2013R\u00e9nyi (ER) and scale-free (SF) networks indicate that increasing both the epidemic infection initial threshold and outbreak threshold, as well as decreasing the virus and epidemic infection probability, can all effectively suppress epidemic spreading and epidemic infection outbreak. With an increase in the epidemic infection outbreak threshold, the increasing pattern of the final epidemic infection scale transitions from a second-order continuous phase transition to a first-order discontinuous phase transition. Additionally, degree distribution heterogeneity also significantly impacts the outbreak and spread of diseases. These findings provide valuable guidance for the formulation of immunization strategies.",

Although it has long been known that such processes take place on social networks, the assumption of \u2018random mixing\u2019 is usually made, which ignores network structure. However, \u2018super-spreading events\u2019 have been found to be power-law distributed, suggesting that the underlying networks may be scale free or at least highly heterogeneous. The random-mixing assumption would then produce an overestimation of the herd-immunity threshold for given R 0; and a (more significant) overestimation of R 0 itself. These two errors compound each other, and can lead to forecasts greatly overestimating the number of infections. Moreover, if networks are heterogeneous and change in time, multiple waves of infection can occur, which are not predicted by random mixing. A simple SIR model simulated on both Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi and scale-free networks shows that details of the network structure can be more important than the intrinsic transmissibility of a disease.

By adjusting the heterogeneity coefficient and clustering coefficient of the hyperbolic scale-free network, four distinct network structures with notable differences can be obtained. We then map pairwise and three-way interactions to 2-hyperedges and 3-hyperedges, constructing a hypergraph model with higher-order interactions. Our findings reveal that when the proportion of three-way interactions exceeds a critical threshold, cooperative tendencies exhibit explosive growth, leading to a bistable phenomenon of coexisting cooperation and defection. The system's average degree significantly influences the critical mass of initial cooperators needed to maintain stable cooperative behavior. The network structure shows complex, non-linear effects on cooperation. In low-conditions, increasing heterogeneity acts to suppress the appearance of bistable phenomena, while in high clustering conditions, it acts to promote. Increasing clustering tends to suppress the appearance of bistable phenomena in both low and high heterogeneity conditions. Furthermore, the effects of heterogeneity, clustering, and noise factors on cooperation are non-monotonic, exhibiting inverted U-shaped patterns with critical transition points. These findings provide new theoretical perspectives for understanding diverse cooperation patterns in real-world scenarios and suggest the need for dynamic, context-specific approaches when designing strategies to promote cooperation.",

                    "abstract": "The detection of an epidemic source or the patient zero is an important practical problem that can help in developing the epidemic control strategies. In this paper, we study the statistical inference problem of detecting the source of epidemics from a snapshot of a contagion spreading process at some time on an arbitrary network structure. By using exact analytic calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate the detectability limits for the SIR model, which primarily depend on the spreading process characteristics. We introduce an efficient Bayesian Monte Carlo source probability estimator and compare its performance against state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the approach in a realistic setting of an epidemic spreading over an empirical temporal network of sexual interactions. Introduction The majority of biological, technological, social and information systems structures can be represented as a complex network [1, 2, 3]. The most prevalent type of dynamic processes of public interest characteristic for the real-life complex networks are contagion processes [4]. Different mathematical methods have been used to study the epidemic spreading on complex networks including the bond percolation method [7, 8], the mean-field approach [9, 10], the reaction-diffusion processes [11, 12], pair and the master equation approximations [13] as well as models with the complex compartmental structure along with population mobility dynamics [14]. Epidemiologists detect the epidemic source or the patient-zero either by analysing the temporal genetic evolution of virus strains [5] or try to do a contact backtracking [6] from the available observed data. However, in cases where the information on the times of contact is unknown, or incomplete, the backtracking method is no longer adequate. This 1 ar X iv :1 40 6. 29 09 v1 [ cs .S I] 1 1 Ju n 20 14 becomes especially hard if the only data available is a static snapshot of a epidemic process at some time. Even in cases when we do have some information on the times of contact, the longer the recovery time and subtler the symptoms the harder it becomes to establish the proper ordering of the transmissions that have occurred. Due to its practical aspects and theoretical importance, the epidemic source detection problem on contact networks has recently gained a lot of attention in complex network science community. This has led to the development of many different source detection estimators for static networks, which vary in their assumptions on the network structure and the spreading process models [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. For the source detection with the SI model the following interesting results have been obtained. Zaman et. al. developed a rumor centrality measure, which is the maximum likelihood estimator for regular trees under the SI model [15]. Dong et. al. also studied the problem of rooting the rumor source with the SI model and demonstrated the asymptotic source detection probability on regular tree-type networks [16]. Comin et. al. compared the different centrality measures e.g. the degree, the betweenness, the closeness and the eigenvector centrality as the source detection estimators [22]. Wang et. al. addressed the problem of source estimation from multiple observations under the SI model [17]. Pinto et. al. used the SI model and assumed that the direction and the times of the infection are known exactly, and solved diffusion tree problem using breadth first search from sparsely placed observers [19]. In the case of the SIR model there are two different approaches. Zhu et. al. adopted the SIR model and proposed a sample path counting approach for the source detection [18]. They proved that the source node on infinite trees minimizes the maximum distance (Jordan centrality) to the infected nodes. Lokhov et. al. used a dynamic message-passing algorithm (DMP) for the SIR model to estimate the probability that a given node produces the observed snapshot. They use a mean-field-like approximation (independence approximation) and an assumption of a tree-like contact network to compute the marginal probabilities [20]. The main contributions of the paper are the following: (i) given the non-uniqueness of finding a single epidemic source of the SIR realization on general networks, we turn the problem to finding a source probability distribution, which is a well-posed problem; (ii) we develop the analytic combinatoric and the direct Monte-Carlo approaches for determining theoretical source probability distribution and produce the benchmark solutions on the 4-connected lattice; (iii) we measure the source detectability by using the normalized Shannon entropy of the estimated source probability distribution for each of the source detection problems and observe the existence of the highly detectable and the highly undetectable regimes; (iv) using the above insights, we construct the Soft Margin epidemic source detection estimator for the arbitrary networks (static and temporal) and show that it is robust and more accurate than the state-ofthe-art approaches and much faster than the analytic combinatoric or the direct Monte-Carlo approach; (v) by using the simulations of the sexually transmitted disease (STD) model on a realistic time interval of 200 days on an empirical temporal network of sexual contacts (see the network visualization in Figure 4, plot C) we demonstrate the robustness to the uncertainty in the epidemic starting time, the network interaction orderings and in incompleteness of observations. Although we use the SIR model of epidemic spreading, our algorithms are easily applicable to other compartmental models, e.g. SI and SEIR and all other compartmental models where the states cannot be recurrent. 1 Detectability limits The main goals of this work are to better understand the nature of the epidemic source detection problem in networks, characterize its complexity, and develop efficient algorithms for estimating source probability distribution. Next, we introduce the terminology and formalize the problem. In a general case, the contactnetwork during an epidemic process can be temporal",

Recently, network-based disease models have integrated traditional compartment-based modeling with real-world contact graphs and shown promising results. However, in an ongoing epidemic, future contact network patterns are not observed yet. To address this, we use aggregated static networks to approximate future contacts for disease modeling. The standard method in the literature concatenates all edges from a dynamic graph into one collapsed graph, called the full static graph. However, the full static graph often leads to severe overestimation of key epidemic characteristics. Therefore, we propose two novel static network approximation methods, DegMST and EdgeMST, designed to preserve the sparsity of real world contact network while remaining connected. DegMST and EdgeMST use the frequency of temporal edges and the node degrees respectively to preserve sparsity. Our analysis show that our models more closely resemble the network characteristics of the dynamic graph compared to the full static ones. Moreover, our analysis on seven real-world contact networks suggests EdgeMST yield more accurate estimations of disease dynamics for epidemic forecasting when compared to the standard full static method.",

A better understanding of epidemic transmission dynamics can contribute to more efficient prevention and control measures. Compartmental models, which assume homogeneous mixing of the population, have been widely used in the study of epidemic transmission dynamics, while agent-based models rely on a network definition for individuals. In this study, we developed a real-scale contact-dependent dynamic (CDD) model and combined it with the traditional susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) compartment model. By considering individual random movement and disease spread, our simulations using the CDD-SEIR model reveal that the distribution of agent types in the community exhibits spatial heterogeneity. The estimated basic reproduction number R0 depends on group mobility, increasing logarithmically in strongly heterogeneous cases and saturating in weakly heterogeneous conditions. Notably, R0 is approximately independent of virus virulence when group mobility is low. We also show that transmission through small amounts of long-term contact is possible due to short-term contact patterns. The dependence of R0 on environment and individual movement patterns implies that reduced contact time and vaccination policies can significantly reduce the virus transmission capacity in situations where the virus is highly transmissible (i.e., R0 is relatively large). This work provides new insights into how individual movement patterns affect virus spreading and how to protect people more efficiently.",

Despite correlations between structural and epidemic parameters, our framework demonstrates robustness in accurately inferring contact network properties from synthetic epidemic simulations. Additionally, we apply the framework to real-world outbreaks, namely the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth disease outbreak and the COVID-19 epidemic in Seoul, to estimate both disease parameters and network characteristics. Our results show that our framework achieves good fits to real-world epidemic data and reliable short-term forecasts.

However, the influence of the vital dynamics of the hosts (i.e., birth-death processes) on the network structure, and their effects on the pattern of epidemics, have received less attention in the scientific community. Here, we study Susceptible-Infected-Recovered(-Susceptible) [SIR(S)] contact processes in standard networks (of Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi and Barab\u00e1si-Albert type) that are subject to host demography. Accounting for the vital dynamics of hosts is far from trivial, and it causes the scale-free networks to lose their characteristic fat-tailed degree distribution. We introduce a broad class of models that integrate the birth and death of individuals (nodes) with the simplest mechanisms of infection and recovery, thus generating age-degree structured networks of hosts that interact in a complex manner. In our models, the epidemiological state of each individual may depend both on the number of contacts (which changes through time because of the birth-death process) and on its age, paving the way for a possible age-dependent description of contagion and recovery processes. We study how the proportion of infected individuals scales with the number of contacts among them. Rather unexpectedly, we discover that the result of highly connected individuals at the highest risk of infection is not as general as commonly believed. In infections that confer permanent immunity to individuals of vital populations (SIR processes), the nodes that are most likely to be infected are those with intermediate degrees. Our age-degree structured models allow such findings to be deeply analyzed and interpreted, and they may aid in the development of effective prevention policies.",

In particular, the dissemination of negative information can contribute to vaccine hesitancy, thereby exacerbating infectious disease outbreaks. This study investigates strategies to mitigate anti-vaccine social contagion through effective counter-campaigns that disseminate positive vaccine information and encourage vaccine uptake, aiming to reduce the size of epidemics. In a coupled agent-based model that consists of opinion and disease diffusion processes, we explore and compare different heuristics to design positive campaigns based on the network structure and local presence of negative vaccine attitudes. We examine two campaigning regimes: a static regime with a fixed set of targets, and a dynamic regime in which targets can be updated over time. We demonstrate that strategic targeting and engagement with the dynamics of anti-vaccine influence diffusion in the network can effectively mitigate the spread of anti-vaccine sentiment, thereby reducing the epidemic size. However, the effectiveness of the campaigns differs across different targeting strategies and is impacted by a range of factors. We find that the primary advantage of static campaigns lies in their capacity to act as an obstacle, preventing the clustering of emerging anti-vaccine communities, thereby resulting in smaller and unconnected anti-vaccine groups. On the other hand, dynamic campaigns reach a broader segment of the population and adapt to the evolution of anti-vaccine diffusion, not only protecting susceptible agents from negative influence but also fostering positive propagation within negative regions.",

Second, the movement path of tourists was designed based on the shortest path. Subsequently, every infected person's information, such as the city, infection time, onset and hospitalization, was confirmed based on their movement path. Third, the features of the transmission path and time distribution of the epidemic were characterized after summarizing the information. Finally, the reliability of the model was verified. The number of citizens and tourists in every city remained stable during this time. The results indicated that a larger basic reproduction number (R0) and population outflow rate signify a faster growth rate of infected people in each city in the network. Compared with small and medium-sized cities, the epidemic spread faster in central cities. Population mobility was the decisive factor causing the spread of the epidemic to other areas. Therefore, the rapid spread of epidemics can be prevented by swiftly reducing the flow of people between cities.",

                    "abstract": "This paper presents a theoretical investigation of the spread of infectious diseases (including Covid-19) in a population network. The central idea is that a population can actually be considered as a network of interlinked nodes. The nodes represent the members of the population, the edges between the nodes the social contacts linking 2 population members. Infections spread throughout the population along these network edges. The actual spread of infections is described within the framework of the SIR compartmental model. Special emphasis is laid on understanding and on the interpretation of phenomena in terms of concepts borrowed from condensed-matter and statistical physics. To obtain a mathematical framework that deals with the influence of the network structure and topology, the original SIR model by Kermack and McKendrick was augmented, leading to a system of differential equations that is in principle exact, but the solution of which appears to be intractable. Therefore, combined algebraic/numerical solutions are presented for simplified (approximative) cases that nevertheless capture the essentials of the effect of the network details on the spread of an infection. Solutions of this kind were successfully tested against the results of direct statistical simulations based on Monte-Carlo methods, indicating the appropriateness of the model. Expressions for the (basic) reproduction numbers in terms of the model parameters are presented, and justify some mild criticisms on the widely spread interpretation of reproduction numbers as being the number of secondary infections due to a single active infection. Throughout the entire paper, special attention is paid to the concept of herd-immunity, its nature and its definition. The model allows for obtaining an exact (algebraic) criterion for the most relevant form of herd-immunity to occur in unvaccinated populations. Analysis of the effects of vaccination leads to an even more general version of this criterion in terms of not only the model parameters but also the effectiveness of the vaccine(s) and the vaccination rate(s). This general criterion is also exact within the context of the SIR model. Furthermore it is shown that the onset of herd-immunity can be considered as a 2nd-order phase transition of the kind that is known from thermodynamics and statistical physics, thus offering a fundamentally new viewpoint on the phenomenon. The role of percolation is highlighted and extensively investigated. It is shown that the herd-immunity transition is actually related to a percolation transition, and marks therewith the transition from a regime where the cumulative infections grow into a large macroscopic cluster that spans a major part of the population, towards a regime were the cumulative infections only occur in smaller secondary clusters of limited size. It appears that percolation phenomena become particularly important in the case of (strict) lock-downs. It is also demonstrated how a system of differential equations can be obtained that accounts for the presence of such percolation phenomena. The analyses presented in this paper also provide insight in how various measures to prevent an epidemic spread of an infection work, how they can be optimised and what potentially deceptive issues have to be considered when such measures are either implemented or scaled down. Herd-immunity appears to be a particularly tricky concept in this respect. Phenomena such as a saturation of the cumulative infection number or a fade-out of the number of active infections may easily be mistaken for a stable case of herd-immunity setting in, whereas in reality such phenomena may be no more than an artefact of protective or contact-reducing measures taken, without any meaning for the vulnerability of a population at large under normal (social) conditions. On the other hand, the paper also highlights and explains the theoretical possibility of \"smothering\" an epidemic via very restrictive measures that prevent it from developing out of a limited number of initial seed-infections.",

The quenched connections introduce dynamic correlations, indicating that the infection of one node increases the likelihood of infection among its neighboring nodes. These dynamic correlations pose significant difficulties in developing comprehensive theories for threshold determination. Determining the precise epidemic threshold is pivotal for diseases control. In this study, we propose a general protocol for accurately determining epidemic thresholds by introducing a new set of fundamental conditions, where the number of connections between individuals of each type remains constant in the stationary state, and by devising a rescaling method for infection rates. Our general protocol is applicable to diverse epidemic models, regardless of the number of stages and transmission modes. To validate our protocol\u2019s effectiveness, we apply it to two widely recognized standard models, the susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered-susceptible model and the contact process model, both of which have eluded precise threshold determination using existing sophisticated theories.

The model contains six parameters: the probabilities p for a susceptible to become infected by contact with an infective; the respective birth rates bs, and bi of the susceptibles from either a susceptible or an infective parent; the respective death rates ds, and di of susceptibles and infectives; and a parameter m characterizing the motion of the individuals. The model has three fixed points. The first is trivial, it describes a stationary state with no living individuals. The second corresponds to a disease-free state with no infectives. The third and last one characterizes an endemic state with non-zero densities of susceptibles and infectives. Moreover, the model may exhibit oscillatory behaviour of the susceptible and infective densities as functions of time through a Hopf-type bifurcation.

In this study, we propose a novel modelling framework integrating the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into homogeneous models, by introducing a continuous recruitment process for the susceptibles. A neural network approximates the recruitment rate to develop a Universal Differential Equations (UDE) model. Simultaneously, we pre-set a specific form for the recruitment rate and develop a mechanistic model. Data from a COVID Omicron variant outbreak in Shanghai are used to train the UDE model using deep learning methods and to calibrate the mechanistic model using MCMC methods. Subsequently, we project the attack rate and peak of new infections for the first Omicron wave in China after the adjustment of the dynamic zero-COVID policy. Our projections indicate an attack rate and a peak of new infections of 80.06% and 3.17% of the population, respectively, compared with the homogeneous model\u2019s projections of 99.97% and 32.78%, thus providing an 18.6% improvement in the prediction accuracy based on the actual data.

It is well known that treatment can have a specific effect on the spread of epidemics, and due to the limited resources of treatment, the number of patients during severe disease outbreaks who need to be treated may exceed the treatment capacity. Consequently, the number of patients who receive treatment will reach a saturation level. Thus, we incorporated a saturated treatment function into the model to characterize such a phenomenon. The dynamics of the present model is discussed in this paper. We first obtained a threshold value R0, which determines the stability of a disease-free equilibrium. Furthermore, we investigated the bifurcation behavior at R0=1. More specifically, we derived a condition that determines the direction of bifurcation at R0=1. If the direction is backward, then a stable disease-free equilibrium concurrently exists with a stable endemic equilibrium even though R0<1. Therefore, in this case, R0<1 is not sufficient to eradicate the disease from the population. However, if the direction is forward, we find that for a range of parameters, multiple equilibria could exist to the left and right of R0=1. In this case, the initial infectious invasion must be controlled to a lower level so that the disease dies out or approaches a lower endemic steady state.",

We systematically analyze these two issues\u2014relationships among differing results and levels of accuracy\u2014by studying the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model on uncorrelated configuration networks and a group of 56 real-world networks. In uncorrelated configuration networks the MFL and DMP methods yield identical predictions that are larger and more accurate than the prediction generated by the QMF method. As for the 56 real-world networks, the epidemic threshold obtained by the DMP method is more likely to reach the accurate epidemic threshold because it incorporates full network topology information and some dynamical correlations. We find that in most of the networks with positive degree-degree correlations, an eigenvector localized on the high k-core nodes, or a high level of clustering, the epidemic threshold predicted by the MFL method, which uses the degree distribution as the only input information, performs better than the other two methods.",

We find unexpectedly that these models violate classical intuition which holds that the herd immunity threshold should monotonically increase with the transmission parameter. We find the existence of bifurcations in the herd immunity threshold in the high transmission probability regime. The extent of these bifurcations is modulated by the graph heterogeneity, the recovery parameter, and the network size. In the limit of large, well-mixed networks, the behavior approaches that of difference equation models, suggesting this behavior is a universal feature of all discrete-time SIR models. These results suggest careful attention is needed in both selecting the assumptions on how to model time and heterogeneity in epidemiological models and the subsequent conclusions that can be drawn.",

However, in the real world, the scenario is different. The network-based framework allows us to capture the complex interdependencies and structural heterogeneity present in real-world systems. We examine two distinct scenarios involving the dynamics of susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) in interconnected networks. In the first part, we show how the epidemic threshold of a contact network changes as a result of being coupled with another network for a fixed infection strength. The model employed in this work considers both the contact networks and interconnections as generic. We have depicted the epidemic threshold curve for interconnected networks, considering the assumption that the infection could be initially present in either one or both of the networks. If the normalized infection strengths are above the threshold curve, the infection spreads, whereas if the normalized infection strengths are below the threshold curve, the disease does not spread. This is true for any level of interconnection. In the second part, we investigate the spillover phenomenon, where the disease in a novel host population network comes from a reservoir network. We have observed a clear phase transition when the number of links or the inter-network infection rate exceeds a certain threshold, keeping all other parameters constant. We observe two regimes for spillover: a major spillover region and a minor spillover region based on interpopulation links (fraction of links between two networks) and inter-network infection strength (infection rate between reservoir and host network). If the interpopulation links and inter-network infection strength are in the major spillover region, the spillover probability is high, while if the former parameters are in the minor spillover region, the spillover probability is low. When the number of infected individuals within a reservoir network is nearly equal, and the inter-network infection strength remains constant, the threshold number of links required to achieve the spillover threshold condition varies based on the network topology. Overall, this work contributes to the understanding of SIR dynamics in interconnected networks and sheds light on the behavior of epidemics in complex systems.",

Each considered SIR-network model captures a class of vaccination behaviours influenced by epidemic characteristics, interaction topology, and imitation dynamics. Our focus is the resultant vaccination coverage, produced under voluntary vaccination schemes, in response to these varying factors. Using the next generation matrix method, we analytically derive and compare expressions for the basic reproduction number R0 for the proposed SIR-network models. Furthermore, we simulate the epidemic dynamics over time for the considered models, and show that if individuals are sufficiently responsive towards the changes in the disease prevalence, then the more expansive travelling patterns encourage convergence to the endemic, mixed equilibria. On the contrary, if individuals are insensitive to changes in the disease prevalence, we find that they tend to remain unvaccinated. Our results concur with earlier studies in showing that residents from highly connected residential areas are more likely to get vaccinated. We also show that the existence of the individuals committed to receiving vaccination reduces R0 and delays the disease prevalence, and thus is essential to containing epidemics.",

Under various vaccine action models, we consider both household-based vaccination schemes, in which the way in which individuals are chosen for vaccination depends on the size of the households in which they reside, and acquaintance vaccination, which targets individuals of high degree in the social network. For both types of vaccination scheme, assuming a large population with few initial infectives, we derive a threshold parameter which determines whether or not a large outbreak can occur and also the probability of a large outbreak and the fraction of the population infected by a large outbreak. The performance of these schemes is studied numerically, focusing on the influence of the household size distribution and the degree distribution of the social network. We find that acquaintance vaccination can significantly outperform the best household-based scheme if the degree distribution of the social network is heavy-tailed. For household-based schemes, when the vaccine coverage is insufficient to prevent a major outbreak and the vaccine is imperfect, we find situations in which both the probability and size of a major outbreak under the scheme which minimises the threshold parameter are larger than in the scheme which maximises the threshold parameter.",

Public awareness plays a crucial role, as individual vaccination decisions significantly impact collective efforts to combat emerging health threats. This study explores disease transmission within a framework integrating social connections, information sharing, and individual vaccination decisions. We introduce a behaviour-prevalence model on an adaptive multiplex network, where the physical layer (Layer-II) captures disease transmission under vaccination. In contrast, the virtual layer (Layer-I) represents adaptive social contacts and the flow of information, shaping vaccination decisions within a socially influenced environment. We derive analytical expressions for the epidemic threshold using the microscopic Markov Chain Method (MMCM). Simulation results highlight that adaptive social contacts lead to a higher epidemic threshold than non-adaptive networks. Additionally, network characteristics, such as the power-law exponent in scale-free networks, significantly impact infection spread within populations. Our results reveal that changes in perceived infection risk and an individual\u2019s sensitivity to non-vaccinated neighbour\u2019s status strongly influence vaccine uptake across populations.

In particular, the dissemination of negative information can contribute to vaccine hesitancy, thereby exacerbating infectious disease outbreaks. This study investigates strategies to mitigate anti-vaccine social contagion through effective counter-campaigns that disseminate positive vaccine information and encourage vaccine uptake, aiming to reduce the size of epidemics. In a coupled agent-based model that consists of opinion and disease diffusion processes, we explore and compare different heuristics to design positive campaigns based on the network structure and local presence of negative vaccine attitudes. We examine two campaigning regimes: a static regime with a fixed set of targets, and a dynamic regime in which targets can be updated over time. We demonstrate that strategic targeting and engagement with the dynamics of anti-vaccine influence diffusion in the network can effectively mitigate the spread of anti-vaccine sentiment, thereby reducing the epidemic size. However, the effectiveness of the campaigns differs across different targeting strategies and is impacted by a range of factors. We find that the primary advantage of static campaigns lies in their capacity to act as an obstacle, preventing the clustering of emerging anti-vaccine communities, thereby resulting in smaller and unconnected anti-vaccine groups. On the other hand, dynamic campaigns reach a broader segment of the population and adapt to the evolution of anti-vaccine diffusion, not only protecting susceptible agents from negative influence but also fostering positive propagation within negative regions.",

In this work, we consider the edge-based compartmental model (EBCM), a compact and analytically tractable framework, and we integrate it within dynamical survival analysis (DSA) to infer key network properties along with parameters of the epidemic itself. Despite correlations between structural and epidemic parameters, our framework demonstrates robustness in accurately inferring contact network properties from synthetic epidemic simulations. Additionally, we apply the framework to real-world outbreaks, namely the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth disease outbreak and the COVID-19 epidemic in Seoul, to estimate both disease parameters and network characteristics. Our results show that our framework achieves good fits to real-world epidemic data and reliable short-term forecasts.

Calibrating these models requires representative network sampling. We investigate the Random Walk (RW) and Metropolis-Hastings Random Walk (MHRW) algorithms for three network types: Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi (ER), Small-world (SW), and Scale-free (SF). Disease transmission is simulated using a stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) framework. For ER and SW networks, RW overestimates infected individuals and secondary infections by $25\\%$ due to size bias, favouring highly connected nodes. MHRW, though more computationally intensive, reduces size bias and provides more representative samples. For time-to-infection, both algorithms provide representative estimates. However, neither algorithm samples SF networks representatively, exhibiting significant variability. Furthermore, removing duplicate sample nodes reduces MHRW's accuracy across three network types. We apply both algorithms to a cattle movement network of 46,512 farms combining ER, SW, and SF features. RW overestimates infected farms by about $100\\%$ and secondary infections by over $900\\%$, reflecting significant size bias, while MHRW estimates align within $1\\%$ of the cattle network values. RW underestimates time-to-infection by about $40\\%$, while MHRW overestimates it by $10\\%$. Accuracy, again, deteriorates when duplicates nodes are removed. Our findings guide algorithm selection and intervention strategies based on network structure and disease severity; RW's conservative estimates suit high-mortality, fast-spreading epidemics, while MHRW enables more precise interventions for slower epidemics.",

In general, power graphs are sparsely connected, scale-free with consecutive numbering, which cannot be directly synthesized by existing random graph models, such as the Edr\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi model. This article proposes a modified Edr\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi random graph model (itself and Gilbert) to generate synthetic power graphs. Using vertex and component rewiring, the proposed algorithm can obtain sparsely connected graphs with average degree between 2 and 3 for different graph sizes. The proposed algorithm also uses reordering to obtain consecutive vertex numbering, and therefore, it can generate synthetic power graphs with a structure similar to power graphs. In addition to the structure of synthetic power graphs, the proposed algorithm provides some auxiliary operational data for the generated synthetic power graphs, i.e., the location of zero injection buses. The simulation results of optimal PMU placement problem for three IEEE cases and three real cases show the similarities of the two versions of generated graphs to the power graphs in terms of network structure and operational data. Also, the flexibility of the two versions of the proposed model in generating graphs with different network structures as well as operational data are shown in two simulations related to the domination number problem.",

Specifically, we use the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model but propose to explicitly consider the road network structure in the model to understand the contagion process of road congestion. This departs from the classical SIR model where homogeneous mixing based on the law of mass action is assumed. For this purpose, we adopt the N-intertwined modeling framework for the SIR model based on continuous-time Markov chain analysis. In our evaluation, we used two real-world traffic datasets collected in California and Los Angeles. We compare our results against both classical and average-degree-based SIR models.

Yet generally, the virus may evolve due to the influence of environments and medical interventions, or the information may be modified by individuals in networks. In this letter, we investigate the spread of two competing viruses in a network, where one of the viruses can mutate into the other one with a certain probability. Based on the multi-group susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model, a mathematical model is proposed to describe the spread of viruses with mutations. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the zero equilibrium, and the conditions for the existence, uniqueness, and local exponential stability of the coexisting equilibrium. Our results demonstrate that the mutation can affect the spreading ability of the virus and the coexistence of viruses. Moreover, we show the effect of mutation on the proportion of infected individuals by comparing it with the model without mutation.",

Network theory provides tools that allow these patterns to be quantified, and can provide greater understanding of important community properties, including community stability, than can documenting pairwise species interactions. I characterized the interactions of multiple, co\u2010occurring invasive and native species in an old field woody plant community to build plant interaction networks at two different life stages. With the goal of identifying structural features that may operate to maintain species coexistence, I characterized the architecture of these networks at multiple scales: the entire network, the substructures that compose the network and species' roles within substructures. I found that species\u2010level pairwise interactions alone did not provide an accurate or sufficiently detailed picture of community structure. Rather, using a network approach, I identified substructures that have the potential to promote and hinder species coexistence in interactions among seedlings. Characterizing the nuances of network substructures was illuminating, as the size of the substructures and the pattern of interaction intensities within substructures influence the expected effects on species coexistence. Including interactions at multiple life stages was also important; the seedling species that benefited most from the nested structure of facilitative interactions with adults occupied subordinate roles in substructures with other seedlings. This role reversal at different life stages is a potential factor promoting coexistence in the community. Last, the network framework was useful for comparing species' roles between native and invasive members of the community, and the three invasive species in this system had different, life stage\u2010dependent strategies in interactions with co\u2010occurring plants. Synthesis. The interplay of network architecture and substructures within plant communities and among plants at different life stages is important for understanding species coexistence. In the plant community characterized in this study, there were several features that may promote coexistence, and these features were not observable in interactions within a single life stage or when considering pairwise interactions independently.",

                    "abstract": "Interacting epidemics on diverse multilayer networks are increasingly important in modeling and analyzing the diffusion processes of real complex systems. A viral agent spreading on one layer of a multilayer network can interact with its counterparts by promoting (cooperative interaction), suppressing (competitive interaction), or inducing (collaborating interaction) its diffusion on other layers. Collaborating interaction displays different patterns: (i) random collaboration, where intralayer or interlayer induction has the same probability; (ii) concentrating collaboration, where consecutive intralayer induction is guaranteed with a probability of 1; and (iii) cascading collaboration, where consecutive intralayer induction is banned with a probability of 0. In this paper, we develop a top-bottom framework that uses only two distributions, the overlaid degree distribution and edge-type distribution, to model collaborating epidemics on multilayer networks. We then state the response of three collaborating patterns to structural diversity (evenness and difference of network layers). For viral agents with small transmissibility, we find that random collaboration is more effective in networks with higher diversity (high evenness and difference), while the concentrating pattern is more suitable in uneven networks. Interestingly, the cascading pattern requires a network with moderate difference and high evenness, and the moderately uneven coupling of multiple network layers can effectively increase robustness to resist cascading failure. With large transmissibility, however, we find that all collaborating patterns are more effective in high-diversity networks. Our work provides a systemic analysis of collaborating epidemics on multilayer networks. The results enhance our understanding of biotic and informative diffusion through multiple vectors.",

However, modelling more general interactions between dynamical systems has remained an open problem. Here, we present a dynamic dependency framework that can capture interdependent and competitive interactions between dynamic systems, which we use to study synchronization and spreading processes in multilayer networks with interacting layers. By developing a mean-field theory, which we verify by simulations, we find coupled collective phenomena, including multistability, regions of coexistence, and macroscopic chaos. In interdependent dynamics, in particular, we observe hysteretic behaviours with abrupt (hybrid and explosive) transitions, that exhibit universal features that match those emerging from interdependent percolation. This dynamic dependency framework provides a powerful tool with which to improve our understanding of many of the interacting complex systems surrounding us.A dynamic dependency framework describes general interdependent and competitive interactions between nodes in multilayer networks and is used to study spreading phenomena.",

The notion of pcores is introduced, with help of which the components of MLN that are directly involved in the implementation of intersystem interactions are distinguished. Methods of reducing the complexity of multilayer network models are investigated, which allow us to significantly decrease their dimensionality and better understand the processes that take place in complex network systems and intersystem interactions of different types. Using the introduced local and global structural characteristics of elements, effective scenarios of targeted attacks on monoflow partially overlapped multilayer networks have been developed, the main attention of which is focused on the transition points of MLN through which intersystem interactions are actually realized. It is shown that these scenarios can also be used to solve the inverse problem, namely, which elements of MLN should be blocked in the first place to prevent the acceleration of spread of epidemics of dangerous infectious diseases, etc. _______________________________________________________________________________________",

The purpose of these models has been to determine the conditions under which a virus becomes rapidly extinct in a network. The most common models of virus propagation in networks are SIS-type models or their variants. In such models, the conditions that lead to a rapid extinction of the spread of a computer virus have been calculated and its dependence on some parameters inherent to the mathematical model has been observed. In this article, we will try to analyze a particular SIS-type model proposed in the past by Chakrabarti as well as an SIRS-type variation of this model proposed in the past by myself. I will show through simulations the influence that the topology of a network has on the dynamics of the spread of a virus in different network types. In the recent past, there have been interesting articles that demonstrate the relationship between the eigenvalue \u03bb1 of the adjacency matrix and the reduction in the spread of a virus in a network. From this, the minimization of the spectral radius strategies by edge suppression has been proposed. This problem is NP-complete in its general case and for this reason, heuristic algorithms have been proposed. In this article, I will perform simulations of an SIS-type model in topologies with the same number of nodes but with different structures to compare their epidemic behavior. The simulations will show that regular topologies with small node degrees, i.e., of degree 4, as is the case of the topology that I call Lattice4, have favorable behavior in terms of the fast extinction property, with respect to other denser and less regular topologies such as the binomial topologies as well as Power law topologies. Based on the results of the simulations, my contribution will consist of proposing, as a node isolation strategy, a transformation of the original topology into an approximately regular topology by edge elimination. Although such a transformed topology is not optimal in terms of reducing the propagation of a virus, it induces the rapid extinction of the virus in the network.",

We find unexpectedly that these models violate classical intuition which holds that the herd immunity threshold should monotonically increase with the transmission parameter. We find the existence of bifurcations in the herd immunity threshold in the high transmission probability regime. The extent of these bifurcations is modulated by the graph heterogeneity, the recovery parameter, and the network size. In the limit of large, well-mixed networks, the behavior approaches that of difference equation models, suggesting this behavior is a universal feature of all discrete-time SIR models. These results suggest careful attention is needed in both selecting the assumptions on how to model time and heterogeneity in epidemiological models and the subsequent conclusions that can be drawn.",

The Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered-Hospitalized-Critical-Deaths (SEIR-HCD) model proposed in this research work is identified as a valuable tool for capturing the complex dynamics of disease transmission, healthcare demands, and mortality rates during epidemics.\n\nBackground: The spread of viral diseases is a major problem for public health services all over the world. Understanding how diseases spread is important in order to take the right steps to stop them. In epidemiology, the SIS, SIR, and SEIR models have been used to mimic and study how diseases spread in groups of people.\n\nMethodology: This research focuses on the integration of air traffic network data into the SEIR-HCD model to enhance the understanding of disease spread in air travel settings. By incorporating air traffic data, the model considers the role of travel patterns and connectivity in disease dissemination, enabling the identification of high-risk routes, airports, and regions.\n\nContribution: This research contributes to the field of epidemiology by enhancing our understanding of disease spread dynamics through the application of the SIS, SIR, and SEIR-HCD models. The findings provide insights into the factors influencing disease transmission, allowing for the development of effective strategies for disease control and prevention.\n\nFindings: The interplay between local outbreaks and global disease dissemination through air travel is empirically explored. The model can be further used for the evaluation of the effectiveness of surveillance and early detection measures at airports and transportation hubs. The proposed research contributes to proactive and evidence-based strategies for disease prevention and control, offering insights into the impact of air travel on disease transmission and supporting public health interventions in air traffic networks.\n\nRecommendations for Practitioners: Government intervention can be studied during difficult times which plays as a moderating variable that can enhance or hinder the efficacy of epidemic intelligence efforts within air traffic networks. Expert collaboration from various fields, including epidemiology, aviation, data science, and public health with an interdisciplinary approach can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the disease spread dynamics in air traffic networks. \n\nRecommendation for Researchers: Researchers can collaborate with international health organizations and authorities to share their research findings and contribute to a global understanding of disease spread in air traffic networks.\n\nImpact on Society: This research has significant implications for society. By providing a deeper understanding of disease spread dynamics, it enables policymakers, public health officials, and practitioners to make informed decisions to mitigate disease outbreaks. The recommendations derived from this research can aid in the development of effective strategies to control and prevent the spread of infectious diseases, ultimately leading to improved public health outcomes and reduced societal disruptions.\n\nFuture Research: Practitioners of the research can contribute more effectively to disease outbreaks within the context of air traffic networks, ultimately helping to protect public health and global travel. By considering air traffic patterns, the SEIR-HCD model contributes to more accurate modeling and prediction of disease outbreaks, aiding in the development of proactive and evidence-based strategies to manage and mitigate the impact of infectious diseases in the context of air travel.\n\n",
