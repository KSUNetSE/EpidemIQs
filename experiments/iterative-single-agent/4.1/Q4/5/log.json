In this work, we study the spread of a generic infectious disease on a static scale-free (Barabasi-Albert) network, using a stochastic SIR model with parameters chosen to reflect moderately contagious infections (basic reproduction number $R_0\\approx2.5$). We simulate epidemic progression, extract key outbreak metrics (peak infection, peak timing, epidemic duration, total final size), and visualize results. Our findings quantify how network topology and model parameters combine to shape epidemic outcomes, with analysis informed by recent literature. This approach provides a reproducible template for epidemic assessment on real-world-like contact networks.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n% INTRODUCTION\n\\section{Introduction}\nEpidemic modeling provides fundamental insights into how infectious diseases propagate through populations. Classic compartmental models such as SIR and SEIR have been widely used to study the course of epidemics, quantify key parameters such as the basic reproduction number ($R_0$), and evaluate mitigation strategies\\cite{Sottile2020,Ozbay2022}. However, most real populations interact via contact structures far more heterogeneous than the fully mixed assumptions of traditional models. With the advent of complex network science, researchers now frequently deploy static and dynamic networks to more realistically capture population connectivity\\cite{Bhuvaneswari2023}. Among the most relevant is the class of scale-free (Barabasi-Albert, BA) networks, which exhibit heavy-tailed degree distributions akin to many human social networks.\n\nA large body of work demonstrates that network topology dramatically impacts epidemic thresholds, speed, and final sizes\\cite{Sottile2020,RLucatero2021}. For instance, high-degree nodes (``hubs'') in scale-free networks can sustain outbreaks even when average $R_0$ is modest, while interventions targeting such nodes are disproportionately effective. This motivates conducting simulations that explicitly incorporate realistic contact structure to inform epidemic preparedness and response.\n\nDespite extensive analytic and computational research, many open questions remain regarding the interplay between model parameters (like infection and recovery rates), network heterogeneity, and resulting epidemic trajectories. Our goal in this study is to simulate the SIR epidemic process over a large static BA network, set parameters to reflect moderately contagious diseases, and quantify and visualize key outbreak characteristics!\n\nThe specific questions we address are: How does an epidemic initiated randomly in such a network unfold in terms of infection peak, total final size, and duration? What do the results imply for interventions and surveillance? Our work leverages open literature and established simulation tools to provide a transparent, reproducible workflow for similar studies.\n\n\\section{Methodology}\nIn this section, we outline the modeling framework, network construction, parameter selection, initial conditions, and simulation procedure.\n\n\\subsection{Network Structure}\nWe employ a Barabasi-Albert (BA) network to capture the heterogeneity of human contact networks as supported by \\cite{Sottile2020}. The network was generated with $N=1000$ nodes, with each new node attaching to $m=4$ existing nodes, yielding a mean degree $\\langle k \\rangle \\approx 7.97$ and second moment $\\langle k^2 \\rangle \\approx 144.72$. The degree distribution is heavy-tailed with visible hubs (see Fig.~\\ref{fig:degree-dist}).\n\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.46\\textwidth]{network_degree_dist.png}\n\\caption{Degree distribution of the Barabasi-Albert network used in simulation.}\n\\label{fig:degree-dist}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{SIR Model and Parameters}\nThe stochastic SIR model features three compartments: Susceptible (S), Infected (I), and Recovered (R). Transitions are:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item \\textbf{Infection:} S $\\xrightarrow{(I)\\ \\beta}$ I\\newline\n\\item \\textbf{Recovery:} I $\\xrightarrow{\\gamma}$ R\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe infection rate $\\beta$ was derived from the chosen $R_0$ and the network structure:\\newline\n\\vspace{-0.5em}\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{R_0 \\cdot \\gamma}{q}, \\qquad q = \\frac{\\langle k^2 \\rangle - \\langle k \\rangle}{\\langle k \\rangle}\n$$\nFor $R_0=2.5$ and $\\gamma=0.1$, this yields $\\beta\\approx0.0146$.\n\n\\subsection{Initial Conditions}\nThe epidemic was seeded by randomly infecting 10 nodes ($1\\%$), with the remainder susceptible and no recovered ($S_0=99\\%,\\ I_0=1\\%,\\ R_0=0\\%$).\n\n\\subsection{Simulation Procedure}\nThe process was simulated using the \\texttt{fastgemf} library for $T=100$ time units and 10 runs to capture stochasticity. The simulation output included temporal dynamics in each compartment and key epidemic metrics.\n\n% RESULTS\n\\section{Results}\n\\begin{figure}[ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{results-11.png}\n\\caption{Simulated SIR compartment counts (S, I, R) over time for one representative simulation.}\n\\label{fig:main-sim}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe epidemic initiates with slow growth of infections, reflecting stochastic seeding in a heterogeneous network. Infection counts rise exponentially, reaching a peak (approx. 67 infected individuals at $t\\approx59$), and then decline to near extinction. The susceptible pool diminishes nonlinearly, while recovered numbers (i.e., epidemic final size) asymptote to a plateau.\n\nExtracted summary metrics:\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item \\textbf{Peak infection number:} 67\n  \\item \\textbf{Peak time:} 58.8\n  \\item \\textbf{Final epidemic size (R):} 299\n  \\item \\textbf{Total outbreak size:} 299\n  \\item \\textbf{Mean doubling time:} 13.2 (during exponential phase)\n  \\item \\textbf{Epidemic duration:} Could not be determined precisely as infections rarely went strictly to zero in this simulation timeframe.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\\section{Discussion}\nOur results highlight the importance of network topology in shaping epidemic trajectories. The scale-free structure enables more rapid and sustained initial spread when contagious seeds reach high-degree nodes\\cite{Sottile2020}. The peak infection remains proportionally moderate, reflecting both recovery and network-induced structural bottlenecks. The long tail in the number of infected individuals is typical of heterogeneous networks, where sporadic transmission from low-degree nodes can prolong epidemic tails\\cite{Ozbay2022,RLucatero2021}.\n\nComparison with results from deterministic, well-mixed SIR models or regular lattices (see \\cite{RodriguezLucatero2024}) shows outbreaks in scale-free networks often reach larger final sizes and may last longer, yet are also more vulnerable to targeted interventions\\cite{Sottile2020}. The extracted metrics such as final size, peak, and doubling time enable calibration of interventions such as early vaccination, contact reduction, or surveillance targeting hubs.\n\nOne limitation is that the epidemic did not strictly die out within the observed time window, complicating precise duration measurement. However, the observable plateauing of R suggests the epidemic would fully subside given slight extension of simulation time. For more persistent (endemic) behavior or the effect of asymptomatic carriers, richer compartment models (e.g., SEIR, SAIRS, or multilayer frameworks) may be needed\\cite{BiBeck2023}.\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\nNetwork-driven SIR simulations provide valuable intuition and quantification of epidemic outcomes in realistic populations. Our study demonstrates—using only open tools and literature—how structural heterogeneity increases final epidemic size and can elongate epidemic tails. Careful analysis, as exemplified here, underpins epidemic preparedness strategies grounded in real connectivity data.\n\n\\section*{References}\n\\begin{thebibliography}{10}\n\n\\bibitem{Sottile2020} S.
