In what follows we will show that the answer is different if one considers the full (fast–changing) temporal network versus its “time–aggregated” or static representation.\\n\\nBelow we describe one very common way to “map” the epidemiological parameters (transmission probability per contact β and recovery rate γ) onto the network “contact” rate. (Any answer which is equivalent to the answer below is correct.)\\n\\n────────────────────────────\\nA. (Temporal network)\\n\\nIn the activity–driven model each of the N nodes (here N = 1000) is “active” in a given (small) time–interval with probability α (here α = 0.1) and – when active – makes m new contacts (here m = 2) with other randomly chosen nodes. Notice that, because contacts are created by either end, an infected node may “reach” a susceptible in two ways:\\n \\n1. It may be active and “call” m other nodes.\\n2. It may be reached by a susceptible that is active.\\n\\nSince the two events are independent and (by symmetry) occur at the same rate, one may show that the following is a reasonable approximation (see, e.g., Perra et al., 2012):\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003R₀₍temp₎ = (β/γ) · [mα (from when the infected is active) + mα (from when the susceptible is active)]\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003= (2 m α β)/γ.\\n\\nThus, if we wish R₀ = 3 then we must choose β so that\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003(2 m α β)/γ = 3\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003⟹\\u2003\\u2003β = (3 γ)/(2 m α).\\n\\nFor our numbers (m = 2, α = 0.1) this becomes\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003β = (3 γ)/(2 · 2 · 0.1) = (3 γ)/0.4 = 7.5 γ.\\n\\nThat is, for the temporal network, if you choose a recovery rate γ then the transmission probability β must be set equal to (R₀ γ)/(2 m α) in order to have R₀ = 3.\\n\\n────────────────────────────\\nB. (Time–aggregated static network)\\n\\nIn many cases one “aggregates” the time–varying contacts over a time window (for example, over one typical infectious period, T = 1/γ) so that one obtains a static network. In this static (or “integrated”) network an edge between two nodes exists if they have been in contact at least once during T; in some cases one keeps also a weight w that is proportional to the number (or frequency) of contacts. (This is sometimes done because the epidemic ‘transmissibility’ along an edge will now depend on the cumulative “dose” of exposure.)\\n\\nLet us assume that during T = 1/γ the “integrated” (expected) number of contacts between any two nodes (say i and j) is given by\\n\\u2003\\u2003w = 2 m α (T) / N = 2 m α/(γ N),\\nsince each ordered pair i→j has a contact rate ≈ (m α)/N and there are two “directions.”\\n\\nHowever, one very common approach is not to use the weights directly, but rather to “binzarize” the network: an edge is drawn between i and j if at least one contact occurs during T. In that case the probability that i and j are connected (i.e. that at least one contact occurs) is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003π = 1 – exp[– (2mα)/(N γ)].\\n\\nOne then “lumps” the epidemiological transmission into an effective “transmissibility” along an edge. If in any given contact an infection occurs with probability β, then multiple independent contacts will yield an overall transmission probability along the edge\\n\\u2003\\u2003T_edge = 1 – (1 – β)^(# of contacts).\\n\\nWhen contacts occur according to a Poisson process the overall transmissibility along the aggregated edge is\\n\\u2003\\u2003T_edge = 1 − exp[– β · (expected number of contacts)].\\nIf we imagine that the weight of the edge is now “large” (obtained by aggregating many time steps) one can write, approximately,\\n\\u2003\\u2003T_edge = 1 – exp[– β · w*],\\nwhere w* is an “integrated contact‐intensity” between the two nodes. A common (and simple) choice is to take\\n\\u2003\\u2003w* = 2 m α/γ,\\nwhich is the expected number of contacts an arbitrary node experiences (either by being active or being contacted) during its infectious period (note that in the temporal network we “saw” that the total contact rate is 2 m α). Then the effective probability of transmission along an edge in the time–aggregated network is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003T_edge = 1 – exp[– (2 m α β)/γ].\\n\\nNow, if the aggregated (unweighted) network is homogeneous (i.e. nearly “regular”), then a common mean–field estimate for the reproduction number is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀(static) = T_edge × ⟨k⟩,\\nwhere ⟨k⟩ is the average degree of the aggregated network. If one constructs the aggregated network by “linking” any pair that had at least one contact over T, then one finds\\n\\u2003\\u2003⟨k⟩ ≃ (N – 1) π ≃ N [1 – exp(– (2 m α)/(Nγ))].\\nFor N large and (2 m α)/(Nγ) small, one may approximate\\n\\u2003\\u2003⟨k⟩ ≃ 2 m α/γ,\\nwhich is exactly the total number of distinct contacts per individual in time T.\\n\\nThus one obtains\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀(static) = [1 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ)] × (2 m α/γ).\\n\\nNow if we wish this R₀ (static) to be 3 we must have\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003[1 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ)] · (2 m α/γ) = 3.\\n\\nThat is, the mapping from β to R₀ in the static (aggregated) case is given by\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀(static) = (2 m α/γ) [1 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ)],\\nor, equivalently, one may “calibrate” β by solving\\n\\u2003\\u20031 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ) = (R₀(static)γ)/(2mα).\\nInverting this relation yields\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003β = – (γ/(2 m α)) ln [1 – (R₀(static)γ)/(2 m α)].\\n\\nFor our prescribed R₀(static) = 3 and for m = 2 and α = 0.1 this gives\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003β = – (γ/(0.4)) ln [1 – (3γ)/(0.4)]\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003(so long as (3γ)/(0.4) < 1).\\n\\nNote that (as often happens) the mapping for the static network is nonlinear in β because several contacts can occur along the same edge.\\n\\n────────────────────────────\\nSummary of Answers\\n\\n(a) For the temporal network the mapping is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀(temporal) = (2 m α β)/γ\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003⟹\\u2003\\u2003β = (R₀ γ)/(2 m α).\\n\\nThat is, with m = 2 and α = 0.1:\\n\\u2003\\u2003β = (3 γ)/(0.4) = 7.5 γ.\\n\\n(b) For the aggregated static network (when one “lumps” multiple contacts into a single edge whose effective infection “transmissibility” is T_edge = 1 – exp[–(2 m α β)/γ]), the mapping becomes\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀(static) = (2 m α/γ) [1 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ)].\\n\\nThus, to have R₀(static) = 3 one must choose β so that\\n\\n\\u2003\\u20031 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ) = (3γ)/(2 m α)\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003⟹\\u2003β = – (γ/(2 m α)) ln [1 – (3γ)/(2 m α)].\\n\\nAny answer equivalent to the ones above is correct.\\n\\n────────────────────────────\\nNotes\\n\\n• In the temporal network case the factor 2mα comes from the fact that contacts occur whether the infected node is active (making m contacts) or the susceptible is active (and happens to “choose” the infected), so the effective contact rate is 2 m α.\\n• In the aggregated network case one must “lump” together all the contacts along an edge, which leads to a nonlinear mapping via the exponential.\\n• In practice one must check that (R₀γ)/(2 m α) is less than one so that the logarithm is defined (which is usually the case in the “sparse‐contact” limit).\\n\\n────────────────────────────\\nFinal Answer\\n\\n(a) On the activity–driven (temporal) network, the outbreak reproduction number is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = (2 m α β)/γ,\\nso to achieve R₀ = 3 one sets\\n\\u2003\\u2003β = (3 γ)/(2 m α).\\n\\n(b) On the time–aggregated static network (with edge transmissibility T = 1 – exp[–(2 m α β)/γ] and average degree 2 m α/γ) one has\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = (2 m α/γ)[1 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ)],\\nso that to have R₀ = 3 one must choose β satisfying\\n\\u2003\\u2003β = – (γ/(2 m α)) ln [1 – (3γ)/(2 m α)].\\n\\nAny answer equivalent to these expressions is correct.To validate the analytical calibration using a simulation on a static network, you could run a series of SIR–epidemic simulations on the network that has been constructed by aggregating the contacts over the infectious period. Here is a concise outline of how you would proceed:\\n\\n1. Build the aggregated network:  \\n\\u2003• For a network of N nodes, set up an edge between any two nodes with probability π = 1 – exp[– (2 m α)/(γ N)], which reflects the chance of at least one contact during an infectious period T = 1/γ.  \\n\\u2003• Alternatively, generate the network and assign each edge a weight corresponding to the expected number of contacts (w = 2 m α/γ), if you wish to use the weighted version.\\n\\n2. Define the SIR dynamics on this static network:  \\n\\u2003• Use the effective edge transmissibility T_edge = 1 – exp[– (2 m α β)/γ] so that when an infected node is linked to a susceptible one, the probability of transmitting the infection is given by T_edge.  \\n\\u2003• Simulate the disease progression starting from one or a few seed nodes, letting the infection spread according to the SIR rules (with recovery rate γ).\\n\\n3. Measure epidemic metrics:  \\n\\u2003• Estimate the effective reproduction number (R₀) by averaging the number of secondary infections caused by the initially infected nodes during the early phase of the outbreak.  \\n\\u2003• Compare these empirical estimates with the theoretical prediction:  \\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀(static) = (2 m α/γ) [1 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ)].\\n\\n4. Calibration check:  \\n\\u2003• For given parameters (N = 1000, α = 0.1, m = 2, and the chosen γ and β), you should see that the simulated R₀ is close to 3 if β has been set according to  \\n\\u2003\\u2003β = – (γ/(2 m α)) ln [1 – (3γ)/(2 m α)]  \\n\\u2003\\u2003for the static network.  \\n\\u2003• Running multiple realizations and averaging the outcomes will confirm whether the chosen β achieves R₀ ≈ 3.\\n\\nThis simulation framework provides a direct mechanistic validation of the analytical mapping by checking that the outbreak dynamics on the constructed static network follow the expected epidemic threshold behavior and outbreak sizes.Below is a concise summary of best practices and recommendations for a valid comparative simulation study applying a SIR process on an activity‐driven temporal network versus its static aggregated counterpart when R₀ = 3.\\n\\n1. Simulation Duration:\\n\\u2003• Run the simulation until the outbreak has clearly gone extinct—that is, when there are no infected individuals left.  \\n\\u2003• In practice, choose a simulation time t_max much longer than the typical infectious period (commonly, t_max is at least 10–20 times 1/γ). This ensures both the peak and final size (attack rate) have been reliably observed even if the epidemic proceeds over extended time scales due to network dynamics.\\n\\n2. Initial Conditions:\\n\\u2003• Use a low number of initially infected nodes (e.g., one or a few, corresponding to 0.1–1% of the population) to mimic the early introduction of the disease.  \\n\\u2003• The typical best practice is to choose the initial infections at random across the node population. If the network exhibits heterogeneous activity levels, one may also test specific placements (for example, seeding high–activity nodes in a sensitivity test) but for a fair comparison across the temporal and static network versions an unbiased (random) seeding is most recommended.\\n\\n3. Recommended Outcome Measures:\\n\\u2003• Attack Rate (Final Epidemic Size): Total proportion of nodes that have become infected during the outbreak.  \\n\\u2003• Epidemic Peak: The maximum number of concurrently infected individuals; the timing of the peak (time to peak) is also valuable for understanding outbreak speed.\\n\\u2003• Speed of Spread: Measures such as the growth rate in the early phase, the time to reach a certain fraction of infections, or the overall duration of the epidemic.\\n\\u2003• Additional measures, for comparative purposes, might include the effective reproduction number estimated from the early dynamics and the overall qualitative shape of the epidemic curve.\\n\\nIn summary, to ensure reliable capture of the epidemic’s final size and peak on an activity–driven temporal network, run simulations well past the active outbreak period (until no infections remain), initiate the epidemic with a few randomly chosen infected nodes (or test alternative placements if interested in heterogeneity effects), and compare outcome measures such as the final attack rate, the peak number/timing of infections, and the overall speed of the outbreak. These measures facilitate a meaningful comparison with the behavior observed on the time–aggregated static network.To validate the analytical mapping using a static network simulation, you would:\\n\\n1. Build the Aggregated Network:\\n\\u2003• Construct a static network by linking node pairs if at least one contact occurred during an infectious period T = 1/γ.\\n\\u2003• Use the known contact probability π = 1 – exp[–(2mα)/(γN)] or associate each edge with an expected weight w* = 2mα/γ.\\n\\n2. Implement the SIR Dynamics:\\n\\u2003• Define per‐edge infection using the effective transmissibility T_edge = 1 – exp[–(2mαβ)/γ].\\n\\u2003• Seed the epidemic with a small, randomly chosen set of infected nodes (typically one or a few nodes, corresponding to less than 1% of the population), ensuring unbiased seeding.\\n\\n3. Simulation and Outcome Measurement:\\n\\u2003• Run the SIR simulation on the aggregated network until the epidemic dies out (no infected remain). This usually requires a time span several multiples (e.g., 10–20 times) of the average infectious period (1/γ).\\n\\u2003• Record key epidemic metrics such as:\\n\\u2003\\u2003– Final attack rate (total fraction of nodes ever infected),\\n\\u2003\\u2003– Peak prevalence and the timing of the peak,\\n\\u2003\\u2003– Speed of spread (e.g., early exponential growth rate or time to reach a given number of infections).\\n\\n4. Compare Results:\\n\\u2003• Compare the measured values (attack rate, peak, speed) with the analytical predictions derived from R₀(static) = (2mα/γ)[1 – exp(–(2mαβ)/γ)].\\n\\u2003• Repeat over multiple simulation runs to average out stochastic effects and ensure that the chosen β indeed produces an epidemic with R₀ ≈ 3.\\n\\nThis simulation framework directly validates the mapping between the network–disease parameters and epidemic outcomes on a static (aggregated) network model.A commonly used and practical choice is to take γ = 0.2, corresponding to an average infectious period of 5 days. Here’s why this value works well for comparative studies:\\n\\n1. When time steps correspond to one day, a 5‐day infectious period allows the model to capture daily variations in contact activity while still spanning enough time steps for several activation events to occur. This ensures that both the temporal nuances of the activity‐driven network and the aggregated network (constructed over the infectious period T = 1/γ) are meaningfully represented.\\n\\n2. With γ = 0.2, the activity‐driven dynamics (using, for example, an activation probability α = 0.1 and m = 2 contacts per active node) accumulate a reasonable expected number of contacts over an individual’s infectious period. This makes the mapping to R₀ and the associated calibration of β both reliable and interpretable.\\n\\n3. A 5-day period is long enough to generate sufficient network interactions while not being too long (which could overly smooth the temporal dynamics, reducing the contrast between the temporal and static aggregated picture). In comparative studies where R₀ is set to 3, this time scale provides clarity in the dynamics, peak, and final epidemic size outcomes.\\n\\nOf course, while γ = 0.2 is a reasonable baseline, it is still good practice to perform sensitivity analyses by varying the infectious period (γ values) to ensure that the conclusions drawn are robust across plausible epidemiological scenarios.A practical choice is to take γ = 0.2, so that the average infectious period is 5 days. This value works well for the following reasons:\\n\\n• With one day per time step, a 5‐day infectious period allows the model to capture sufficient daily contact events on the activity‐driven network, ensuring that the dynamics are well resolved.  \\n• The resulting period provides enough time to generate multiple interactions and thus lends credibility to the aggregation process when constructing the static network (aggregated over an average infectious period T = 1/γ).  \\n• γ = 0.2 is epidemiologically reasonable and has been widely used in comparable studies, making the results interpretable and directly comparable when R₀ is set to 3.\\n\\nTo validate this choice using a mechanistic epidemic model on the static network, you would:\\n\\n1. Construct the static network by aggregating contacts over T = 5 days.  \\n2. Run the SIR model until the outbreak dies out (i.e., no infected remain), ensuring the simulation spans several multiples of the infectious period.  \\n3. Measure key outcomes such as the final attack rate (total infected), the epidemic peak (and its timing), and the early growth rate, then compare these to the analytical predictions for R₀ = 3.\\n\\nThis ensures that the chosen γ yields reliable and interpretable dynamics for both the temporal and static aggregated representations.In a population of 1000 nodes, seeding with a single infected node can be prone to stochastic extinction even when R₀ = 3, because early chance events in a small population may prevent the epidemic from taking off. For a robust comparison between the temporal and static aggregated models, it is best to use several simultaneous initial seeds. In practice, using on the order of 5 initial infections is typically recommended as the minimum. This slightly larger seed size helps ensure that the early dynamics reliably enter the deterministic growth phase, minimizing the risk that early stochastic die-out will obscure the differences in epidemic outcomes between the network representations.Using only one infected node in a population of 1000 can lead to significant variability and potential early stochastic die‐out—even if the calibrated R₀ is 3. For robust and reliable comparative studies over static networks, it is best practice to seed with multiple initial infections. A typical recommendation is to use at least 5 simultaneously infected nodes. This larger seed size reduces the likelihood of early extinction, allowing the epidemic to reliably enter the deterministic growth phase and ensuring that outcome measures (attack rate, outbreak peak, and timing) are consistently observed and can be meaningfully compared between the activity‑driven temporal network and its static aggregated counterpart.Over one infectious period T = 1/γ = 5 days the aggregated network is very sparse. Each pair of nodes (i, j) has an independent probability\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003π ≈ 1 – exp[– (2 m α T / N)] = 1 – exp[– (2×2×0.1×5/1000)] ≈ 1 – exp(–0.002) ≈ 0.002\\n\\nof having at least one contact. With ~999 potential neighbors, the expected average degree per node is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003⟨k⟩ ≈ 999 × 0.002 ≈ 2.\\n\\nSince each potential edge appears with roughly equal and small independent probability, the degree distribution is approximately binomial, which, in this sparse limit, tends to a Poisson distribution with mean 2—just like in a classical Erdős–Rényi (ER) random graph with p ≈ 0.002. \\n\\nThus, when aggregated over an infectious period, the resulting static network closely resembles an ER graph in terms of average degree and (unweighted) degree distribution, with only minor deviations that might arise from repeated contacts or correlations in the underlying temporal activity that are usually negligible in this regime.To validate the analytical prediction using a static network simulation, you would:\\n\\n1. Construct the Aggregated Static Network:\\n\\u2003• Aggregate contacts over T = 1/γ (here, 5 days) by linking each pair of nodes with probability π = 1 – exp[–(2mαT/N)]. For m = 2, α = 0.1, N = 1000, and T = 5, this yields π ≈ 0.002, so that the expected degree is ⟨k⟩ ≈ (N – 1)π ≈ 2.\\n\\u2003• In this sparse limit, the degree distribution should be approximately binomial (and hence Poisson for large N), just as in an Erdős–Rényi graph with similar parameters.\\n\\n2. Run the SIR Mechanistic Model:\\n\\u2003• Implement the SIR process on the aggregated network, using the effective edge-transmissibility T_edge = 1 – exp[–(2mαβ)/γ] (with β calibrated appropriately to achieve R₀ = 3).\\n\\u2003• Seed the epidemic (preferably with a few initial infections to reduce early extinction) and run the simulation until the outbreak dies out.\\n\\n3. Validate the Results:\\n\\u2003• Compare the simulated average degree and degree distribution to the theoretical predictions (⟨k⟩ ≈ 2, near-Poisson shape).\\n\\u2003• Measure key epidemic outcomes (attack rate, peak prevalence, time to peak) and verify that they align with the analytical expectations derived for an ER-like network.\\n\\u2003• Observing that the simulation outcomes follow the expected behavior confirms that the static network closely resembles an ER graph in this regime.\\n\\nThis process directly validates the analytical mapping and ensures that the static aggregated network behaves as predicted when used in an epidemic mechanistic model.') \n ======\nNow please create a step by step plan through chain-of-thought ** Focus exclusively on design of the mechanistic model**\nImportant: Your should Solely focus on parametric compartmental model network structure, do not set values for the parameters or initial conditions.", "output": "Certainly!

Identify Network Structure for Induction Rule\n\n- Recognize two network frameworks per scenario:\n    1. Activity-driven Temporal Network\n        - At each time step, nodes form ephemeral contacts according to their activity—network rewired at every step.\n        - Infection transmission can only happen through edges present in the ephemeral network at that timestep.\n    2. Time-Aggregated Static Network\n        - Edges represent the union of contacts aggregated over an infectious period; edges are persistent for the entire simulation.\n        - Each edge encodes cumulative contact (possibly as a simple unweighted link, or with weight indicating number of contacts).\n\n- For the **model**, abstract out the infectious contact process to:\n    - S and I are connected by an edge given by the current network snapshot (temporal or static).\n    - When S is connected to I, S transitions to I with probability per contact event.\n\n### 5. Formulate Mechanistic Transition Rules (Parametric, General)\n\n- Express the infection process as functions of:\n    - Underlying network structure at the current time step.\n    - Transmission parameter β (per-contact or per-edge transmissibility).\n- Recovery is independent of network, governed by γ across all models.\n\n### 6. Ensure Model Generality and Compatibility\n\n- Clearly separate the model compartment dynamics (states and transitions) from the network implementation.\n- The same SIR transition rules (compartmental framework) must be compatible with both network types, with their network-specific contact structures handled externally (by the simulation engine or network generator).\n\n### 7. Specify Mechanistic Model Structure\n\n- Enumerate all elements:\n    - Model name: SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered)\n    - Compartments: [\"S\", \"I\", \"R\"]\n    - Transitions:\n        - S -(I)-> I : \"β\"  [Susceptible moves to Infectious if contacted by Infectious, parameterized by β]\n        - I → R : \"γ\"       [Infectious moves to Recovered at rate γ]\n\n- Articulate that for both network types, the induction of infection (who can potentially transition from S to I) relies on the current contact network—ephemeral for temporal, fixed for static.\n\n### 8. Document Model Structure\n\n- Prepare clear documentation (model schema) explicitly defining:\n    - Compartments\n    - Transition rules (parametric, tied to network contact state)\n    - Network interface (how network determines potential infection pairs)\n    - Independence of recovery from network structure\n\n---\n\n## Reasoning Summary\n\n- This stepwise approach ensures that the core compartmental structure is decoupled from specifics of parameter values or initial conditions, allowing flexible calibration and direct comparison across network instantiations.\n- By strictly defining the compartments and generic, parametric transitions, the model implementation becomes reusable, clear, and simulation-ready across both dynamic and static network topologies.\n- The reliance on the network for S to I transitions captures the fundamental difference between temporal and static contact processes, while the SIR compartmental skeleton remains identical—allowing meaningful, mechanistic comparative analysis.\n\n---\n\n**This plan provides a blueprint for implementing an SIR model on either a dynamically changing (activity-driven) temporal contact network or a time-aggregated, static network, focusing solely on the structural and mechanistic compartmental aspects.**", "error": null, "no_exec_iter": 0, "no_reflections": 0, "meta": {}}

In what follows we will show that the answer is different if one considers the full (fast–changing) temporal network versus its “time–aggregated” or static representation.\\n\\nBelow we describe one very common way to “map” the epidemiological parameters (transmission probability per contact β and recovery rate γ) onto the network “contact” rate. (Any answer which is equivalent to the answer below is correct.)\\n\\n────────────────────────────\\nA. (Temporal network)\\n\\nIn the activity–driven model each of the N nodes (here N = 1000) is “active” in a given (small) time–interval with probability α (here α = 0.1) and – when active – makes m new contacts (here m = 2) with other randomly chosen nodes. Notice that, because contacts are created by either end, an infected node may “reach” a susceptible in two ways:\\n \\n1. It may be active and “call” m other nodes.\\n2. It may be reached by a susceptible that is active.\\n\\nSince the two events are independent and (by symmetry) occur at the same rate, one may show that the following is a reasonable approximation (see, e.g., Perra et al., 2012):\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003R₀₍temp₎ = (β/γ) · [mα (from when the infected is active) + mα (from when the susceptible is active)]\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003= (2 m α β)/γ.\\n\\nThus, if we wish R₀ = 3 then we must choose β so that\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003(2 m α β)/γ = 3\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003⟹\\u2003\\u2003β = (3 γ)/(2 m α).\\n\\nFor our numbers (m = 2, α = 0.1) this becomes\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003β = (3 γ)/(2 · 2 · 0.1) = (3 γ)/0.4 = 7.5 γ.\\n\\nThat is, for the temporal network, if you choose a recovery rate γ then the transmission probability β must be set equal to (R₀ γ)/(2 m α) in order to have R₀ = 3.\\n\\n────────────────────────────\\nB. (Time–aggregated static network)\\n\\nIn many cases one “aggregates” the time–varying contacts over a time window (for example, over one typical infectious period, T = 1/γ) so that one obtains a static network. In this static (or “integrated”) network an edge between two nodes exists if they have been in contact at least once during T; in some cases one keeps also a weight w that is proportional to the number (or frequency) of contacts. (This is sometimes done because the epidemic ‘transmissibility’ along an edge will now depend on the cumulative “dose” of exposure.)\\n\\nLet us assume that during T = 1/γ the “integrated” (expected) number of contacts between any two nodes (say i and j) is given by\\n\\u2003\\u2003w = 2 m α (T) / N = 2 m α/(γ N),\\nsince each ordered pair i→j has a contact rate ≈ (m α)/N and there are two “directions.”\\n\\nHowever, one very common approach is not to use the weights directly, but rather to “binzarize” the network: an edge is drawn between i and j if at least one contact occurs during T. In that case the probability that i and j are connected (i.e. that at least one contact occurs) is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003π = 1 – exp[– (2mα)/(N γ)].\\n\\nOne then “lumps” the epidemiological transmission into an effective “transmissibility” along an edge. If in any given contact an infection occurs with probability β, then multiple independent contacts will yield an overall transmission probability along the edge\\n\\u2003\\u2003T_edge = 1 – (1 – β)^(# of contacts).\\n\\nWhen contacts occur according to a Poisson process the overall transmissibility along the aggregated edge is\\n\\u2003\\u2003T_edge = 1 − exp[– β · (expected number of contacts)].\\nIf we imagine that the weight of the edge is now “large” (obtained by aggregating many time steps) one can write, approximately,\\n\\u2003\\u2003T_edge = 1 – exp[– β · w*],\\nwhere w* is an “integrated contact‐intensity” between the two nodes. A common (and simple) choice is to take\\n\\u2003\\u2003w* = 2 m α/γ,\\nwhich is the expected number of contacts an arbitrary node experiences (either by being active or being contacted) during its infectious period (note that in the temporal network we “saw” that the total contact rate is 2 m α). Then the effective probability of transmission along an edge in the time–aggregated network is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003T_edge = 1 – exp[– (2 m α β)/γ].\\n\\nNow, if the aggregated (unweighted) network is homogeneous (i.e. nearly “regular”), then a common mean–field estimate for the reproduction number is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀(static) = T_edge × ⟨k⟩,\\nwhere ⟨k⟩ is the average degree of the aggregated network. If one constructs the aggregated network by “linking” any pair that had at least one contact over T, then one finds\\n\\u2003\\u2003⟨k⟩ ≃ (N – 1) π ≃ N [1 – exp(– (2 m α)/(Nγ))].\\nFor N large and (2 m α)/(Nγ) small, one may approximate\\n\\u2003\\u2003⟨k⟩ ≃ 2 m α/γ,\\nwhich is exactly the total number of distinct contacts per individual in time T.\\n\\nThus one obtains\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀(static) = [1 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ)] × (2 m α/γ).\\n\\nNow if we wish this R₀ (static) to be 3 we must have\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003[1 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ)] · (2 m α/γ) = 3.\\n\\nThat is, the mapping from β to R₀ in the static (aggregated) case is given by\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀(static) = (2 m α/γ) [1 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ)],\\nor, equivalently, one may “calibrate” β by solving\\n\\u2003\\u20031 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ) = (R₀(static)γ)/(2mα).\\nInverting this relation yields\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003β = – (γ/(2 m α)) ln [1 – (R₀(static)γ)/(2 m α)].\\n\\nFor our prescribed R₀(static) = 3 and for m = 2 and α = 0.1 this gives\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003β = – (γ/(0.4)) ln [1 – (3γ)/(0.4)]\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003(so long as (3γ)/(0.4) < 1).\\n\\nNote that (as often happens) the mapping for the static network is nonlinear in β because several contacts can occur along the same edge.\\n\\n────────────────────────────\\nSummary of Answers\\n\\n(a) For the temporal network the mapping is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀(temporal) = (2 m α β)/γ\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003⟹\\u2003\\u2003β = (R₀ γ)/(2 m α).\\n\\nThat is, with m = 2 and α = 0.1:\\n\\u2003\\u2003β = (3 γ)/(0.4) = 7.5 γ.\\n\\n(b) For the aggregated static network (when one “lumps” multiple contacts into a single edge whose effective infection “transmissibility” is T_edge = 1 – exp[–(2 m α β)/γ]), the mapping becomes\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀(static) = (2 m α/γ) [1 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ)].\\n\\nThus, to have R₀(static) = 3 one must choose β so that\\n\\n\\u2003\\u20031 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ) = (3γ)/(2 m α)\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003⟹\\u2003β = – (γ/(2 m α)) ln [1 – (3γ)/(2 m α)].\\n\\nAny answer equivalent to the ones above is correct.\\n\\n────────────────────────────\\nNotes\\n\\n• In the temporal network case the factor 2mα comes from the fact that contacts occur whether the infected node is active (making m contacts) or the susceptible is active (and happens to “choose” the infected), so the effective contact rate is 2 m α.\\n• In the aggregated network case one must “lump” together all the contacts along an edge, which leads to a nonlinear mapping via the exponential.\\n• In practice one must check that (R₀γ)/(2 m α) is less than one so that the logarithm is defined (which is usually the case in the “sparse‐contact” limit).\\n\\n────────────────────────────\\nFinal Answer\\n\\n(a) On the activity–driven (temporal) network, the outbreak reproduction number is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = (2 m α β)/γ,\\nso to achieve R₀ = 3 one sets\\n\\u2003\\u2003β = (3 γ)/(2 m α).\\n\\n(b) On the time–aggregated static network (with edge transmissibility T = 1 – exp[–(2 m α β)/γ] and average degree 2 m α/γ) one has\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = (2 m α/γ)[1 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ)],\\nso that to have R₀ = 3 one must choose β satisfying\\n\\u2003\\u2003β = – (γ/(2 m α)) ln [1 – (3γ)/(2 m α)].\\n\\nAny answer equivalent to these expressions is correct.To validate the analytical calibration using a simulation on a static network, you could run a series of SIR–epidemic simulations on the network that has been constructed by aggregating the contacts over the infectious period. Here is a concise outline of how you would proceed:\\n\\n1. Build the aggregated network:  \\n\\u2003• For a network of N nodes, set up an edge between any two nodes with probability π = 1 – exp[– (2 m α)/(γ N)], which reflects the chance of at least one contact during an infectious period T = 1/γ.  \\n\\u2003• Alternatively, generate the network and assign each edge a weight corresponding to the expected number of contacts (w = 2 m α/γ), if you wish to use the weighted version.\\n\\n2. Define the SIR dynamics on this static network:  \\n\\u2003• Use the effective edge transmissibility T_edge = 1 – exp[– (2 m α β)/γ] so that when an infected node is linked to a susceptible one, the probability of transmitting the infection is given by T_edge.  \\n\\u2003• Simulate the disease progression starting from one or a few seed nodes, letting the infection spread according to the SIR rules (with recovery rate γ).\\n\\n3. Measure epidemic metrics:  \\n\\u2003• Estimate the effective reproduction number (R₀) by averaging the number of secondary infections caused by the initially infected nodes during the early phase of the outbreak.  \\n\\u2003• Compare these empirical estimates with the theoretical prediction:  \\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀(static) = (2 m α/γ) [1 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ)].\\n\\n4. Calibration check:  \\n\\u2003• For given parameters (N = 1000, α = 0.1, m = 2, and the chosen γ and β), you should see that the simulated R₀ is close to 3 if β has been set according to  \\n\\u2003\\u2003β = – (γ/(2 m α)) ln [1 – (3γ)/(2 m α)]  \\n\\u2003\\u2003for the static network.  \\n\\u2003• Running multiple realizations and averaging the outcomes will confirm whether the chosen β achieves R₀ ≈ 3.\\n\\nThis simulation framework provides a direct mechanistic validation of the analytical mapping by checking that the outbreak dynamics on the constructed static network follow the expected epidemic threshold behavior and outbreak sizes.Below is a concise summary of best practices and recommendations for a valid comparative simulation study applying a SIR process on an activity‐driven temporal network versus its static aggregated counterpart when R₀ = 3.\\n\\n1. Simulation Duration:\\n\\u2003• Run the simulation until the outbreak has clearly gone extinct—that is, when there are no infected individuals left.  \\n\\u2003• In practice, choose a simulation time t_max much longer than the typical infectious period (commonly, t_max is at least 10–20 times 1/γ). This ensures both the peak and final size (attack rate) have been reliably observed even if the epidemic proceeds over extended time scales due to network dynamics.\\n\\n2. Initial Conditions:\\n\\u2003• Use a low number of initially infected nodes (e.g., one or a few, corresponding to 0.1–1% of the population) to mimic the early introduction of the disease.  \\n\\u2003• The typical best practice is to choose the initial infections at random across the node population. If the network exhibits heterogeneous activity levels, one may also test specific placements (for example, seeding high–activity nodes in a sensitivity test) but for a fair comparison across the temporal and static network versions an unbiased (random) seeding is most recommended.\\n\\n3. Recommended Outcome Measures:\\n\\u2003• Attack Rate (Final Epidemic Size): Total proportion of nodes that have become infected during the outbreak.  \\n\\u2003• Epidemic Peak: The maximum number of concurrently infected individuals; the timing of the peak (time to peak) is also valuable for understanding outbreak speed.\\n\\u2003• Speed of Spread: Measures such as the growth rate in the early phase, the time to reach a certain fraction of infections, or the overall duration of the epidemic.\\n\\u2003• Additional measures, for comparative purposes, might include the effective reproduction number estimated from the early dynamics and the overall qualitative shape of the epidemic curve.\\n\\nIn summary, to ensure reliable capture of the epidemic’s final size and peak on an activity–driven temporal network, run simulations well past the active outbreak period (until no infections remain), initiate the epidemic with a few randomly chosen infected nodes (or test alternative placements if interested in heterogeneity effects), and compare outcome measures such as the final attack rate, the peak number/timing of infections, and the overall speed of the outbreak. These measures facilitate a meaningful comparison with the behavior observed on the time–aggregated static network.To validate the analytical mapping using a static network simulation, you would:\\n\\n1. Build the Aggregated Network:\\n\\u2003• Construct a static network by linking node pairs if at least one contact occurred during an infectious period T = 1/γ.\\n\\u2003• Use the known contact probability π = 1 – exp[–(2mα)/(γN)] or associate each edge with an expected weight w* = 2mα/γ.\\n\\n2. Implement the SIR Dynamics:\\n\\u2003• Define per‐edge infection using the effective transmissibility T_edge = 1 – exp[–(2mαβ)/γ].\\n\\u2003• Seed the epidemic with a small, randomly chosen set of infected nodes (typically one or a few nodes, corresponding to less than 1% of the population), ensuring unbiased seeding.\\n\\n3. Simulation and Outcome Measurement:\\n\\u2003• Run the SIR simulation on the aggregated network until the epidemic dies out (no infected remain). This usually requires a time span several multiples (e.g., 10–20 times) of the average infectious period (1/γ).\\n\\u2003• Record key epidemic metrics such as:\\n\\u2003\\u2003– Final attack rate (total fraction of nodes ever infected),\\n\\u2003\\u2003– Peak prevalence and the timing of the peak,\\n\\u2003\\u2003– Speed of spread (e.g., early exponential growth rate or time to reach a given number of infections).\\n\\n4. Compare Results:\\n\\u2003• Compare the measured values (attack rate, peak, speed) with the analytical predictions derived from R₀(static) = (2mα/γ)[1 – exp(–(2mαβ)/γ)].\\n\\u2003• Repeat over multiple simulation runs to average out stochastic effects and ensure that the chosen β indeed produces an epidemic with R₀ ≈ 3.\\n\\nThis simulation framework directly validates the mapping between the network–disease parameters and epidemic outcomes on a static (aggregated) network model.A commonly used and practical choice is to take γ = 0.2, corresponding to an average infectious period of 5 days. Here’s why this value works well for comparative studies:\\n\\n1. When time steps correspond to one day, a 5‐day infectious period allows the model to capture daily variations in contact activity while still spanning enough time steps for several activation events to occur. This ensures that both the temporal nuances of the activity‐driven network and the aggregated network (constructed over the infectious period T = 1/γ) are meaningfully represented.\\n\\n2. With γ = 0.2, the activity‐driven dynamics (using, for example, an activation probability α = 0.1 and m = 2 contacts per active node) accumulate a reasonable expected number of contacts over an individual’s infectious period. This makes the mapping to R₀ and the associated calibration of β both reliable and interpretable.\\n\\n3. A 5-day period is long enough to generate sufficient network interactions while not being too long (which could overly smooth the temporal dynamics, reducing the contrast between the temporal and static aggregated picture). In comparative studies where R₀ is set to 3, this time scale provides clarity in the dynamics, peak, and final epidemic size outcomes.\\n\\nOf course, while γ = 0.2 is a reasonable baseline, it is still good practice to perform sensitivity analyses by varying the infectious period (γ values) to ensure that the conclusions drawn are robust across plausible epidemiological scenarios.A practical choice is to take γ = 0.2, so that the average infectious period is 5 days. This value works well for the following reasons:\\n\\n• With one day per time step, a 5‐day infectious period allows the model to capture sufficient daily contact events on the activity‐driven network, ensuring that the dynamics are well resolved.  \\n• The resulting period provides enough time to generate multiple interactions and thus lends credibility to the aggregation process when constructing the static network (aggregated over an average infectious period T = 1/γ).  \\n• γ = 0.2 is epidemiologically reasonable and has been widely used in comparable studies, making the results interpretable and directly comparable when R₀ is set to 3.\\n\\nTo validate this choice using a mechanistic epidemic model on the static network, you would:\\n\\n1. Construct the static network by aggregating contacts over T = 5 days.  \\n2. Run the SIR model until the outbreak dies out (i.e., no infected remain), ensuring the simulation spans several multiples of the infectious period.  \\n3. Measure key outcomes such as the final attack rate (total infected), the epidemic peak (and its timing), and the early growth rate, then compare these to the analytical predictions for R₀ = 3.\\n\\nThis ensures that the chosen γ yields reliable and interpretable dynamics for both the temporal and static aggregated representations.In a population of 1000 nodes, seeding with a single infected node can be prone to stochastic extinction even when R₀ = 3, because early chance events in a small population may prevent the epidemic from taking off. For a robust comparison between the temporal and static aggregated models, it is best to use several simultaneous initial seeds. In practice, using on the order of 5 initial infections is typically recommended as the minimum. This slightly larger seed size helps ensure that the early dynamics reliably enter the deterministic growth phase, minimizing the risk that early stochastic die-out will obscure the differences in epidemic outcomes between the network representations.Using only one infected node in a population of 1000 can lead to significant variability and potential early stochastic die‐out—even if the calibrated R₀ is 3. For robust and reliable comparative studies over static networks, it is best practice to seed with multiple initial infections. A typical recommendation is to use at least 5 simultaneously infected nodes. This larger seed size reduces the likelihood of early extinction, allowing the epidemic to reliably enter the deterministic growth phase and ensuring that outcome measures (attack rate, outbreak peak, and timing) are consistently observed and can be meaningfully compared between the activity‑driven temporal network and its static aggregated counterpart.Over one infectious period T = 1/γ = 5 days the aggregated network is very sparse. Each pair of nodes (i, j) has an independent probability\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003π ≈ 1 – exp[– (2 m α T / N)] = 1 – exp[– (2×2×0.1×5/1000)] ≈ 1 – exp(–0.002) ≈ 0.002\\n\\nof having at least one contact. With ~999 potential neighbors, the expected average degree per node is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003⟨k⟩ ≈ 999 × 0.002 ≈ 2.\\n\\nSince each potential edge appears with roughly equal and small independent probability, the degree distribution is approximately binomial, which, in this sparse limit, tends to a Poisson distribution with mean 2—just like in a classical Erdős–Rényi (ER) random graph with p ≈ 0.002. \\n\\nThus, when aggregated over an infectious period, the resulting static network closely resembles an ER graph in terms of average degree and (unweighted) degree distribution, with only minor deviations that might arise from repeated contacts or correlations in the underlying temporal activity that are usually negligible in this regime.To validate the analytical prediction using a static network simulation, you would:\\n\\n1. Construct the Aggregated Static Network:\\n\\u2003• Aggregate contacts over T = 1/γ (here, 5 days) by linking each pair of nodes with probability π = 1 – exp[–(2mαT/N)].

Here is a clear step-by-step plan, using chain-of-thought reasoning, to design the SIR mechanistic compartmental model on both a temporal, activity-driven network and an aggregated static network—**focusing exclusively on the parametric compartmental model and network structure, not parameter values or initial conditions**.\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-step Plan for Mechanistic Model Design\n\n### 1. Identify Appropriate Compartmental Model\n\n- Review the scenario and pathogen description—directly transmitted, acute infectious, with permanent immunity after recovery, appropriate for the classical SIR framework.\n- Decide that the SIR model is mechanistically suitable, capturing the minimum necessary states: Susceptible (S), Infectious (I), and Recovered (R).\n\n### 2. Define Compartments\n\n- Explicitly list the three population states:\n    - S: Susceptible\n    - I: Infectious\n    - R: Recovered\n\n### 3. Specify Disease State Transitions\n\n- Identify the epidemic processes governing transitions between states:\n    - Transmission event: S → I, occurs when a susceptible individual is exposed to an infectious one (the \"inducer\"), through a network contact.\n    - Recovery event: I → R, as recovery occurs at a rate governed by the infectious period.\n\n- Represent these transitions generically:\n    - S -(I)-> I [\"S\" in contact with \"I\" becomes \"I\" at transmission rate β]\n    - I → R [Infectious recovers at rate γ]\n\n### 4. Identify Network Structure for Induction Rule\n\n- Recognize two network frameworks per scenario:\n    1. Activity-driven Temporal Network\n        - At each time step, nodes form ephemeral contacts according to their activity—network rewired at every step.\n        - Infection transmission can only happen through edges present in the ephemeral network at that timestep.\n    2. Time-Aggregated Static Network\n        - Edges represent the union of contacts aggregated over an infectious period; edges are persistent for the entire simulation.\n        - Each edge encodes cumulative contact (possibly as a simple unweighted link, or with weight indicating number of contacts).\n\n- For the **model**, abstract out the infectious contact process to:\n    - S and I are connected by an edge given by the current network snapshot (temporal or static).\n    - When S is connected to I, S transitions to I with probability per contact event.\n\n### 5. Formulate Mechanistic Transition Rules (Parametric, General)\n\n- Express the infection process as functions of:\n    - Underlying network structure at the current time step.\n    - Transmission parameter β (per-contact or per-edge transmissibility).\n- Recovery is independent of network, governed by γ across all models.\n\n### 6. Ensure Model Generality and Compatibility\n\n- Clearly separate the model compartment dynamics (states and transitions) from the network implementation.\n- The same SIR transition rules (compartmental framework) must be compatible with both network types, with their network-specific contact structures handled externally (by the simulation engine or network generator).\n\n### 7. Specify Mechanistic Model Structure\n\n- Enumerate all elements:\n    - Model name: SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered)\n    - Compartments: [\"S\", \"I\", \"R\"]\n    - Transitions:\n        - S -(I)-> I : \"β\"  [Susceptible moves to Infectious if contacted by Infectious, parameterized by β]\n        - I → R : \"γ\"       [Infectious moves to Recovered at rate γ]\n\n- Articulate that for both network types, the induction of infection (who can potentially transition from S to I) relies on the current contact network—ephemeral for temporal, fixed for static.\n\n### 8. Document Model Structure\n\n- Prepare clear documentation (model schema) explicitly defining:\n    - Compartments\n    - Transition rules (parametric, tied to network contact state)\n    - Network interface (how network determines potential infection pairs)\n    - Independence of recovery from network structure\n\n---\n\n## Reasoning Summary\n\n- This stepwise approach ensures that the core compartmental structure is decoupled from specifics of parameter values or initial conditions, allowing flexible calibration and direct comparison across network instantiations.\n- By strictly defining the compartments and generic, parametric transitions, the model implementation becomes reusable, clear, and simulation-ready across both dynamic and static network topologies.\n- The reliance on the network for S to I transitions captures the fundamental difference between temporal and static contact processes, while the SIR compartmental skeleton remains identical—allowing meaningful, mechanistic comparative analysis.\n\n---\n\n**This plan provides a blueprint for implementing an SIR model on either a dynamically changing (activity-driven) temporal contact network or a time-aggregated, static network, focusing solely on the structural and mechanistic compartmental aspects.**", "output": {"name": "SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) on Contact Networks", "compartments": ["S", "I", "R"], "transitions": {"S -(I)-> I": "β", "I -> R": "γ"}, "reasoning_info": "This compartmental model is selected based on the scenario: a directly transmitted, acute infectious disease with permanent immunity, best described by the classical SIR framework.

In what follows we will show that the answer is different if one considers the full (fast–changing) temporal network versus its “time–aggregated” or static representation.\\n\\nBelow we describe one very common way to “map” the epidemiological parameters (transmission probability per contact β and recovery rate γ) onto the network “contact” rate. (Any answer which is equivalent to the answer below is correct.)\\n\\n────────────────────────────\\nA. (Temporal network)\\n\\nIn the activity–driven model each of the N nodes (here N = 1000) is “active” in a given (small) time–interval with probability α (here α = 0.1) and – when active – makes m new contacts (here m = 2) with other randomly chosen nodes. Notice that, because contacts are created by either end, an infected node may “reach” a susceptible in two ways:\\n \\n1. It may be active and “call” m other nodes.\\n2. It may be reached by a susceptible that is active.\\n\\nSince the two events are independent and (by symmetry) occur at the same rate, one may show that the following is a reasonable approximation (see, e.g., Perra et al., 2012):\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003R₀₍temp₎ = (β/γ) · [mα (from when the infected is active) + mα (from when the susceptible is active)]\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003= (2 m α β)/γ.\\n\\nThus, if we wish R₀ = 3 then we must choose β so that\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003(2 m α β)/γ = 3\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003⟹\\u2003\\u2003β = (3 γ)/(2 m α).\\n\\nFor our numbers (m = 2, α = 0.1) this becomes\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003β = (3 γ)/(2 · 2 · 0.1) = (3 γ)/0.4 = 7.5 γ.\\n\\nThat is, for the temporal network, if you choose a recovery rate γ then the transmission probability β must be set equal to (R₀ γ)/(2 m α) in order to have R₀ = 3.\\n\\n────────────────────────────\\nB. (Time–aggregated static network)\\n\\nIn many cases one “aggregates” the time–varying contacts over a time window (for example, over one typical infectious period, T = 1/γ) so that one obtains a static network. In this static (or “integrated”) network an edge between two nodes exists if they have been in contact at least once during T; in some cases one keeps also a weight w that is proportional to the number (or frequency) of contacts. (This is sometimes done because the epidemic ‘transmissibility’ along an edge will now depend on the cumulative “dose” of exposure.)\\n\\nLet us assume that during T = 1/γ the “integrated” (expected) number of contacts between any two nodes (say i and j) is given by\\n\\u2003\\u2003w = 2 m α (T) / N = 2 m α/(γ N),\\nsince each ordered pair i→j has a contact rate ≈ (m α)/N and there are two “directions.”\\n\\nHowever, one very common approach is not to use the weights directly, but rather to “binzarize” the network: an edge is drawn between i and j if at least one contact occurs during T. In that case the probability that i and j are connected (i.e. that at least one contact occurs) is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003π = 1 – exp[– (2mα)/(N γ)].\\n\\nOne then “lumps” the epidemiological transmission into an effective “transmissibility” along an edge. If in any given contact an infection occurs with probability β, then multiple independent contacts will yield an overall transmission probability along the edge\\n\\u2003\\u2003T_edge = 1 – (1 – β)^(# of contacts).\\n\\nWhen contacts occur according to a Poisson process the overall transmissibility along the aggregated edge is\\n\\u2003\\u2003T_edge = 1 − exp[– β · (expected number of contacts)].\\nIf we imagine that the weight of the edge is now “large” (obtained by aggregating many time steps) one can write, approximately,\\n\\u2003\\u2003T_edge = 1 – exp[– β · w*],\\nwhere w* is an “integrated contact‐intensity” between the two nodes. A common (and simple) choice is to take\\n\\u2003\\u2003w* = 2 m α/γ,\\nwhich is the expected number of contacts an arbitrary node experiences (either by being active or being contacted) during its infectious period (note that in the temporal network we “saw” that the total contact rate is 2 m α). Then the effective probability of transmission along an edge in the time–aggregated network is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003T_edge = 1 – exp[– (2 m α β)/γ].\\n\\nNow, if the aggregated (unweighted) network is homogeneous (i.e. nearly “regular”), then a common mean–field estimate for the reproduction number is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀(static) = T_edge × ⟨k⟩,\\nwhere ⟨k⟩ is the average degree of the aggregated network. If one constructs the aggregated network by “linking” any pair that had at least one contact over T, then one finds\\n\\u2003\\u2003⟨k⟩ ≃ (N – 1) π ≃ N [1 – exp(– (2 m α)/(Nγ))].\\nFor N large and (2 m α)/(Nγ) small, one may approximate\\n\\u2003\\u2003⟨k⟩ ≃ 2 m α/γ,\\nwhich is exactly the total number of distinct contacts per individual in time T.\\n\\nThus one obtains\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀(static) = [1 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ)] × (2 m α/γ).\\n\\nNow if we wish this R₀ (static) to be 3 we must have\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003[1 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ)] · (2 m α/γ) = 3.\\n\\nThat is, the mapping from β to R₀ in the static (aggregated) case is given by\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀(static) = (2 m α/γ) [1 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ)],\\nor, equivalently, one may “calibrate” β by solving\\n\\u2003\\u20031 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ) = (R₀(static)γ)/(2mα).\\nInverting this relation yields\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003β = – (γ/(2 m α)) ln [1 – (R₀(static)γ)/(2 m α)].\\n\\nFor our prescribed R₀(static) = 3 and for m = 2 and α = 0.1 this gives\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003β = – (γ/(0.4)) ln [1 – (3γ)/(0.4)]\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003(so long as (3γ)/(0.4) < 1).\\n\\nNote that (as often happens) the mapping for the static network is nonlinear in β because several contacts can occur along the same edge.\\n\\n────────────────────────────\\nSummary of Answers\\n\\n(a) For the temporal network the mapping is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀(temporal) = (2 m α β)/γ\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003⟹\\u2003\\u2003β = (R₀ γ)/(2 m α).\\n\\nThat is, with m = 2 and α = 0.1:\\n\\u2003\\u2003β = (3 γ)/(0.4) = 7.5 γ.\\n\\n(b) For the aggregated static network (when one “lumps” multiple contacts into a single edge whose effective infection “transmissibility” is T_edge = 1 – exp[–(2 m α β)/γ]), the mapping becomes\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀(static) = (2 m α/γ) [1 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ)].\\n\\nThus, to have R₀(static) = 3 one must choose β so that\\n\\n\\u2003\\u20031 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ) = (3γ)/(2 m α)\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003⟹\\u2003β = – (γ/(2 m α)) ln [1 – (3γ)/(2 m α)].\\n\\nAny answer equivalent to the ones above is correct.\\n\\n────────────────────────────\\nNotes\\n\\n• In the temporal network case the factor 2mα comes from the fact that contacts occur whether the infected node is active (making m contacts) or the susceptible is active (and happens to “choose” the infected), so the effective contact rate is 2 m α.\\n• In the aggregated network case one must “lump” together all the contacts along an edge, which leads to a nonlinear mapping via the exponential.\\n• In practice one must check that (R₀γ)/(2 m α) is less than one so that the logarithm is defined (which is usually the case in the “sparse‐contact” limit).\\n\\n────────────────────────────\\nFinal Answer\\n\\n(a) On the activity–driven (temporal) network, the outbreak reproduction number is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = (2 m α β)/γ,\\nso to achieve R₀ = 3 one sets\\n\\u2003\\u2003β = (3 γ)/(2 m α).\\n\\n(b) On the time–aggregated static network (with edge transmissibility T = 1 – exp[–(2 m α β)/γ] and average degree 2 m α/γ) one has\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = (2 m α/γ)[1 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ)],\\nso that to have R₀ = 3 one must choose β satisfying\\n\\u2003\\u2003β = – (γ/(2 m α)) ln [1 – (3γ)/(2 m α)].\\n\\nAny answer equivalent to these expressions is correct.To validate the analytical calibration using a simulation on a static network, you could run a series of SIR–epidemic simulations on the network that has been constructed by aggregating the contacts over the infectious period. Here is a concise outline of how you would proceed:\\n\\n1. Build the aggregated network:  \\n\\u2003• For a network of N nodes, set up an edge between any two nodes with probability π = 1 – exp[– (2 m α)/(γ N)], which reflects the chance of at least one contact during an infectious period T = 1/γ.  \\n\\u2003• Alternatively, generate the network and assign each edge a weight corresponding to the expected number of contacts (w = 2 m α/γ), if you wish to use the weighted version.\\n\\n2. Define the SIR dynamics on this static network:  \\n\\u2003• Use the effective edge transmissibility T_edge = 1 – exp[– (2 m α β)/γ] so that when an infected node is linked to a susceptible one, the probability of transmitting the infection is given by T_edge.  \\n\\u2003• Simulate the disease progression starting from one or a few seed nodes, letting the infection spread according to the SIR rules (with recovery rate γ).\\n\\n3. Measure epidemic metrics:  \\n\\u2003• Estimate the effective reproduction number (R₀) by averaging the number of secondary infections caused by the initially infected nodes during the early phase of the outbreak.  \\n\\u2003• Compare these empirical estimates with the theoretical prediction:  \\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀(static) = (2 m α/γ) [1 – exp(– (2 m α β)/γ)].\\n\\n4. Calibration check:  \\n\\u2003• For given parameters (N = 1000, α = 0.1, m = 2, and the chosen γ and β), you should see that the simulated R₀ is close to 3 if β has been set according to  \\n\\u2003\\u2003β = – (γ/(2 m α)) ln [1 – (3γ)/(2 m α)]  \\n\\u2003\\u2003for the static network.  \\n\\u2003• Running multiple realizations and averaging the outcomes will confirm whether the chosen β achieves R₀ ≈ 3.\\n\\nThis simulation framework provides a direct mechanistic validation of the analytical mapping by checking that the outbreak dynamics on the constructed static network follow the expected epidemic threshold behavior and outbreak sizes.Below is a concise summary of best practices and recommendations for a valid comparative simulation study applying a SIR process on an activity‐driven temporal network versus its static aggregated counterpart when R₀ = 3.\\n\\n1. Simulation Duration:\\n\\u2003• Run the simulation until the outbreak has clearly gone extinct—that is, when there are no infected individuals left.  \\n\\u2003• In practice, choose a simulation time t_max much longer than the typical infectious period (commonly, t_max is at least 10–20 times 1/γ). This ensures both the peak and final size (attack rate) have been reliably observed even if the epidemic proceeds over extended time scales due to network dynamics.\\n\\n2. Initial Conditions:\\n\\u2003• Use a low number of initially infected nodes (e.g., one or a few, corresponding to 0.1–1% of the population) to mimic the early introduction of the disease.  \\n\\u2003• The typical best practice is to choose the initial infections at random across the node population. If the network exhibits heterogeneous activity levels, one may also test specific placements (for example, seeding high–activity nodes in a sensitivity test) but for a fair comparison across the temporal and static network versions an unbiased (random) seeding is most recommended.\\n\\n3. Recommended Outcome Measures:\\n\\u2003• Attack Rate (Final Epidemic Size): Total proportion of nodes that have become infected during the outbreak.  \\n\\u2003• Epidemic Peak: The maximum number of concurrently infected individuals; the timing of the peak (time to peak) is also valuable for understanding outbreak speed.\\n\\u2003• Speed of Spread: Measures such as the growth rate in the early phase, the time to reach a certain fraction of infections, or the overall duration of the epidemic.\\n\\u2003• Additional measures, for comparative purposes, might include the effective reproduction number estimated from the early dynamics and the overall qualitative shape of the epidemic curve.\\n\\nIn summary, to ensure reliable capture of the epidemic’s final size and peak on an activity–driven temporal network, run simulations well past the active outbreak period (until no infections remain), initiate the epidemic with a few randomly chosen infected nodes (or test alternative placements if interested in heterogeneity effects), and compare outcome measures such as the final attack rate, the peak number/timing of infections, and the overall speed of the outbreak. These measures facilitate a meaningful comparison with the behavior observed on the time–aggregated static network.To validate the analytical mapping using a static network simulation, you would:\\n\\n1. Build the Aggregated Network:\\n\\u2003• Construct a static network by linking node pairs if at least one contact occurred during an infectious period T = 1/γ.\\n\\u2003• Use the known contact probability π = 1 – exp[–(2mα)/(γN)] or associate each edge with an expected weight w* = 2mα/γ.\\n\\n2. Implement the SIR Dynamics:\\n\\u2003• Define per‐edge infection using the effective transmissibility T_edge = 1 – exp[–(2mαβ)/γ].\\n\\u2003• Seed the epidemic with a small, randomly chosen set of infected nodes (typically one or a few nodes, corresponding to less than 1% of the population), ensuring unbiased seeding.\\n\\n3. Simulation and Outcome Measurement:\\n\\u2003• Run the SIR simulation on the aggregated network until the epidemic dies out (no infected remain). This usually requires a time span several multiples (e.g., 10–20 times) of the average infectious period (1/γ).\\n\\u2003• Record key epidemic metrics such as:\\n\\u2003\\u2003– Final attack rate (total fraction of nodes ever infected),\\n\\u2003\\u2003– Peak prevalence and the timing of the peak,\\n\\u2003\\u2003– Speed of spread (e.g., early exponential growth rate or time to reach a given number of infections).\\n\\n4. Compare Results:\\n\\u2003• Compare the measured values (attack rate, peak, speed) with the analytical predictions derived from R₀(static) = (2mα/γ)[1 – exp(–(2mαβ)/γ)].\\n\\u2003• Repeat over multiple simulation runs to average out stochastic effects and ensure that the chosen β indeed produces an epidemic with R₀ ≈ 3.\\n\\nThis simulation framework directly validates the mapping between the network–disease parameters and epidemic outcomes on a static (aggregated) network model.A commonly used and practical choice is to take γ = 0.2, corresponding to an average infectious period of 5 days. Here’s why this value works well for comparative studies:\\n\\n1. When time steps correspond to one day, a 5‐day infectious period allows the model to capture daily variations in contact activity while still spanning enough time steps for several activation events to occur. This ensures that both the temporal nuances of the activity‐driven network and the aggregated network (constructed over the infectious period T = 1/γ) are meaningfully represented.\\n\\n2. With γ = 0.2, the activity‐driven dynamics (using, for example, an activation probability α = 0.1 and m = 2 contacts per active node) accumulate a reasonable expected number of contacts over an individual’s infectious period. This makes the mapping to R₀ and the associated calibration of β both reliable and interpretable.\\n\\n3. A 5-day period is long enough to generate sufficient network interactions while not being too long (which could overly smooth the temporal dynamics, reducing the contrast between the temporal and static aggregated picture). In comparative studies where R₀ is set to 3, this time scale provides clarity in the dynamics, peak, and final epidemic size outcomes.\\n\\nOf course, while γ = 0.2 is a reasonable baseline, it is still good practice to perform sensitivity analyses by varying the infectious period (γ values) to ensure that the conclusions drawn are robust across plausible epidemiological scenarios.A practical choice is to take γ = 0.2, so that the average infectious period is 5 days. This value works well for the following reasons:\\n\\n• With one day per time step, a 5‐day infectious period allows the model to capture sufficient daily contact events on the activity‐driven network, ensuring that the dynamics are well resolved.  \\n• The resulting period provides enough time to generate multiple interactions and thus lends credibility to the aggregation process when constructing the static network (aggregated over an average infectious period T = 1/γ).  \\n• γ = 0.2 is epidemiologically reasonable and has been widely used in comparable studies, making the results interpretable and directly comparable when R₀ is set to 3.\\n\\nTo validate this choice using a mechanistic epidemic model on the static network, you would:\\n\\n1. Construct the static network by aggregating contacts over T = 5 days.  \\n2. Run the SIR model until the outbreak dies out (i.e., no infected remain), ensuring the simulation spans several multiples of the infectious period.  \\n3. Measure key outcomes such as the final attack rate (total infected), the epidemic peak (and its timing), and the early growth rate, then compare these to the analytical predictions for R₀ = 3.\\n\\nThis ensures that the chosen γ yields reliable and interpretable dynamics for both the temporal and static aggregated representations.In a population of 1000 nodes, seeding with a single infected node can be prone to stochastic extinction even when R₀ = 3, because early chance events in a small population may prevent the epidemic from taking off. For a robust comparison between the temporal and static aggregated models, it is best to use several simultaneous initial seeds. In practice, using on the order of 5 initial infections is typically recommended as the minimum. This slightly larger seed size helps ensure that the early dynamics reliably enter the deterministic growth phase, minimizing the risk that early stochastic die-out will obscure the differences in epidemic outcomes between the network representations.Using only one infected node in a population of 1000 can lead to significant variability and potential early stochastic die‐out—even if the calibrated R₀ is 3. For robust and reliable comparative studies over static networks, it is best practice to seed with multiple initial infections. A typical recommendation is to use at least 5 simultaneously infected nodes. This larger seed size reduces the likelihood of early extinction, allowing the epidemic to reliably enter the deterministic growth phase and ensuring that outcome measures (attack rate, outbreak peak, and timing) are consistently observed and can be meaningfully compared between the activity‑driven temporal network and its static aggregated counterpart.Over one infectious period T = 1/γ = 5 days the aggregated network is very sparse. Each pair of nodes (i, j) has an independent probability\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003π ≈ 1 – exp[– (2 m α T / N)] = 1 – exp[– (2×2×0.1×5/1000)] ≈ 1 – exp(–0.002) ≈ 0.002\\n\\nof having at least one contact. With ~999 potential neighbors, the expected average degree per node is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003⟨k⟩ ≈ 999 × 0.002 ≈ 2.\\n\\nSince each potential edge appears with roughly equal and small independent probability, the degree distribution is approximately binomial, which, in this sparse limit, tends to a Poisson distribution with mean 2—just like in a classical Erdős–Rényi (ER) random graph with p ≈ 0.002. \\n\\nThus, when aggregated over an infectious period, the resulting static network closely resembles an ER graph in terms of average degree and (unweighted) degree distribution, with only minor deviations that might arise from repeated contacts or correlations in the underlying temporal activity that are usually negligible in this regime.To validate the analytical prediction using a static network simulation, you would:\\n\\n1. Construct the Aggregated Static Network:\\n\\u2003• Aggregate contacts over T = 1/γ (here, 5 days) by linking each pair of nodes with probability π = 1 – exp[–(2mαT/N)]. For m = 2, α = 0.1, N = 1000, and T = 5, this yields π ≈ 0.002, so that the expected degree is ⟨k⟩ ≈ (N – 1)π ≈ 2.\\n\\u2003• In this sparse limit, the degree distribution should be approximately binomial (and hence Poisson for large N), just as in an Erdős–Rényi graph with similar parameters.\\n\\n2. Run the SIR Mechanistic Model:\\n\\u2003• Implement the SIR process on the aggregated network, using the effective edge-transmissibility T_edge = 1 – exp[–(2mαβ)/γ] (with β calibrated appropriately to achieve R₀ = 3).\\n\\u2003• Seed the epidemic (preferably with a few initial infections to reduce early extinction) and run the simulation until the outbreak dies out.\\n\\n3. Validate the Results:\\n\\u2003• Compare the simulated average degree and degree distribution to the theoretical predictions (⟨k⟩ ≈ 2, near-Poisson shape).\\n\\u2003• Measure key epidemic outcomes (attack rate, peak prevalence, time to peak) and verify that they align with the analytical expectations derived for an ER-like network.\\n\\u2003• Observing that the simulation outcomes follow the expected behavior confirms that the static network closely resembles an ER graph in this regime.\\n\\nThis process directly validates the analytical mapping and ensures that the static aggregated network behaves as predicted when used in an epidemic mechanistic model.'); if not, provide your reflection and set the revise True\notherwise, if you are satisfied with the result, set the revise_needed=False\n", "output": {"reflection": "The generated mechanistic model, MechanisticModel(name='SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) on Contact Networks', compartments=['S', 'I', 'R'], transitions={'S -(I)-> I': 'β', 'I -> R': 'γ'}, reasoning_info=...), accurately fulfills the requirements specified in the EpidemicInfo query.
