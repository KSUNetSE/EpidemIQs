Edges are undirected and the network is memoryless (no preferential return). Infectious disease spread is modeled with the SIR mechanistic model: on each time step, each infected node may recover with probability gamma=0.2 (average infectious period 1/gamma = 5 time steps), and each new contact between a susceptible and infected node leads to infection with probability beta=1.5 (see note on probabilistic interpretation below). The network structure is compared in two representations: (1) the original temporal network, and (2) an aggregated static weighted network where each link weight w_ij equals the number of times i and j were connected over the full temporal duration. The modeling protocol should initialize infection according to a single randomly chosen seed infectious node at t=0; the rest of the nodes are susceptible. The experiment will compare key epidemiological outcomes (final epidemic size, fraction infected at peak, time to peak) between temporal and aggregated representations.
