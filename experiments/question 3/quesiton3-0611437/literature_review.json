                    "abstract": "Epidemic outbreaks in the real world are often accompanied by rapid information diffusion, which will change individual behavior patterns and affect the spread of epidemics. The community phenomenon in human society will also have an important impact on the spread of epidemics. This paper mainly considers the above factors to construct a new bilayer network. The activity-driven model is used to generate time-varying online information contact layer network and offline physical contact layer network. The information diffusion of individual online contact layer is used to affect the epidemic spreading dynamics of offline physical contact layer, and the individual mobility factor is used to control the community structure characteristics. In order to obtain the spreading dynamic equation of the whole network and analyze the spreading threshold of the network effectively, the Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) is improved and extended to time-varying networks. Experimental verification using Monte Carlo simulation shows that the proposed method is highly accurate in predicting epidemic outbreak thresholds. The results show that individual mobility has no effect on the epidemic outbreak threshold, but it will affect the final number of infections in each community. The greater the individual contact ability of the online contact layer and the smaller the individual contact ability of the offline contact layer can effectively suppress the epidemic spread. The above findings can play an important reference for the effective prevention and control of epidemic transmission in the real world.",

The intra-group interactions are represented as simplicial structures, while the inter-group connections are represented as pairwise links.

A direct analysis of the model using Markov processes involves the spectral analysis of a transition probability matrix whose size grows exponentially with the number of nodes. To overcome this limitation, we derive an upper-bound on the decay rate of the number of infected nodes in terms of the eigenvalues of a $2 \\times 2$ matrix. Using this upper bound, we propose an efficient algorithm to tune the parameters describing the endogenous preventive measures in order to contain epidemics over time.

Both layers are generated using an activity-driven model, which dynamically models time-varying contacts based on individual activity levels.  \n   - The interplay between rapid information diffusion (online) and epidemic spreading (offline) is captured, showing behavioral responses influence epidemic outcomes.  \n   - The Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) is extended to time-varying networks, enabling derivation of dynamic epidemic threshold and final infection size predictions.  \n   - Key findings: Individual mobility does not alter epidemic outbreak thresholds but shapes infection distribution across communities; enhancing online contact activity while reducing offline physical contacts suppresses epidemics effectively.  \n   - Methodological Significance: The bilayer activity-driven approach realistically captures multiplex social interactions with behavioral feedback, beyond static or single-layer models.  \n   - Citation: Shen et al., *Acta Physica Sinica*, 2023, DOI: 10.7498/aps.72.20222206.\n\n2. **Interaction behavior effects in time-dependent social networks (Huang et al., 2023)**  \n   - Investigates pairwise vs. group interactions modeled via activity-driven networks with temporal dynamics.  \n   - Shows that the proportion and intensity of group versus pairwise interactions distinctly influence epidemic spread: group interactions can either hinder or facilitate outbreak depending on their relative social intensity.  \n   - Presence of weak heterogeneity in individual activities raises epidemic thresholds and reduces overall infection scale.  \n   - This work highlights the complexity of interaction patterns on epidemic outcomes and informs targeted control strategies by modulating social interaction types.  \n   - Citation: Huang et al., *Chinese Physics B*, 2023, DOI: 10.1088/1674-1056/ad147f.\n\n3. **Behavioral changes in coupled simplicial activity-driven networks (Huang et al., 2023)**  \n   - Extends activity-driven models to capture higher-order interactions via simplicial complexes representing intra-group connectivity, alongside pairwise inter-group links.  \n   - Two behavioral adaptations: infected individuals reduce activity (self-quarantine), susceptible individuals limit contacts (self-protection).  \n   - Both behaviors effectively suppress epidemic spread by increasing epidemic thresholds and lowering infection prevalence.  \n   - The protective effect diminishes as group (simplex) size increases, but strengthening inter-group pairwise links does not reduce behavioral benefits.  \n   - This model integrates realistic social behavioral adaptations impacting epidemic dynamics on time-varying, higher-order networks.  \n   - Citation: Huang et al., *Journal of Statistical Mechanics*, 2023, DOI: 10.1088/1742-5468/ad0a83.\n\n4. **Optimal epidemic containment over temporal activity-driven networks (Ogura et al., 2018)**  \n   - Proposes an adaptive network epidemic model where network topology evolves due to exogenous changes and endogenous behavioral responses to infection states.  \n   - Introduces a spectral method bounding infection decay rate by eigenanalysis of a low-dimensional matrix, circumventing computational explosion for large networks.  \n   - Derives algorithms optimizing behavioral parameters (e.g., social distancing intensities) to effectively contain epidemics in temporal activity-driven frameworks.  \n   - This analytical approach facilitates practical epidemic control strategy design on realistic adaptive temporal networks.  \n   - Citation: Ogura et al., *ArXiv*, 2018, DOI: 10.1137/18M1172740.\n\n5. **Inclusion of self-excitement and behavioral factors in activity-driven models (Zino et al., 2019)**  \n   - Extends the activity-driven framework by incorporating self-excitement (temporal clustering of contacts) and activity reduction due to infection status.  \n   - Demonstrates through analysis and simulation that the balance between heightened activity due to excitement and reduction from sickness governs epidemic potential.  \n   - Identifies threshold conditions where behavioral feedback either enhances or inhibits spread, adding realism to epidemic modeling on temporal networks.  \n   - Citation: Zino et al., *European Control Conference*, 2019, DOI:10.23919/ECC.2019.8795748.\n\n---\n\n### Integrated Insights and Scientific Contributions\n\n- **Modeling innovation:** The reviewed works collectively advance epidemic simulations by embedding activity-driven frameworks that allow time-varying, heterogeneous social contacts, adaptable behavior, and multiplex/higher-order interactions (bilayer and simplicial networks). These approaches improve upon static or purely dyadic static networks by capturing realistic social dynamics critical for epidemic propagation.  \n\n- **Behavioral dynamics as epidemic modulators:** Multiple papers underscore that behavioral responses (e.g., self-quarantine, self-protection, activity reduction on infection) strongly influence epidemic thresholds and outbreak sizes. Incorporating these into activity-driven models is crucial for fidelity in epidemic forecasts and intervention evaluations.  \n\n- **Control and containment strategies:** Spectral and Markovian analysis yields computationally tractable methods to estimate epidemic thresholds and design control policies in temporal activity-driven networks. Tailoring individual activity parameters and interaction modalities provides effective mechanisms to contain spread.  \n\n- **Importance of interaction structure:** Differentiation between pairwise and group interactions, and between online and offline contact layers, is vital. The structure and intensity of social interactions combined with individual mobility patterns produce complex epidemic outcomes informing targeted control measures.  \n\n---\n\n### Answer to Your Query: Activity-Driven Model Epidemic Simulation\n\nThe activity-driven modeling framework is extensively utilized to simulate epidemic spreading on temporal social networks by assigning individuals activity potentials that generate time-varying contacts. State-of-the-art studies (Shen et al., Huang et al.) extend this to multilayer networks combining online/offline interactions, and to include behavioral adaptations like self-quarantine reducing activity after infection. The models incorporate pairwise and higher-order (group) interactions, and dynamic behavioral feedback that modulates contact activity, enabling precise epidemic threshold calculation and prediction of outbreak sizes. Methods like the Microscopic Markov Chain Approach and spectral bounds enable analytical insights on epidemic thresholds and inform optimal intervention strategies. Importantly, variations in individual mobility and contact types substantially affect epidemic scale, while strategic enhancement or suppression of activity in different contact layers can effectively mitigate spread.\n\n---\n\n### References\n\n- Shen et al.

One of the key assumptions of ADNs is the lack of preferential connections among individuals. This assumption hinders the application of ADNs to several realistic scenarios where some contacts persist in time, rather than intermittently activate. Here, we examine an improved modeling framework that superimposes an ADN to a static backbone network, toward the integration of persistent contacts with time-varying connections. To demonstrate the interplay between the ADN and the static backbone, we investigate the effect of behavioral changes on the disease dynamics. In this framework, each individual may adapt his/her activity as a function of the health status, thereby adjusting the relative weight of time-varying versus static links. To illustrate the approach, we consider two classes of backbone networks, Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi and random regular, and two disease models, SIS and SIR. A general mean-field theory is established for predicting the epidemic threshold, and numerical simulations are conducted to shed light on the role of network parameters on the epidemic spreading and estimate the epidemic size.",

In particular, we focus on how the epidemic threshold of the SIR model is affected by the heterogeneity of nodal activities and the memory strength in temporal and static regimes, respectively. While strong ties (memory) between nodes inhibit the spread of epidemic to be localized, the heterogeneity of nodal activities enhances it to be globalized initially. Since the epidemic threshold of the SIR model is very sensitive to the degree distribution of nodes in static networks, we test the SIR model on the modified ADTNs with the possible set of the activity exponents and the memory exponents that generates the same degree distributions in temporal networks. We also discuss the role of spatiotemporal scaling properties of the largest cluster and the maximum degree in the epidemic threshold. It is observed that the presence of highly active nodes enables to trigger the initial spread of epidemic in a short period of time, but it also limits its final spread to the entire network. This implies that there is the trade-off between the spreading time of epidemic and its outbreak size. Finally, we suggest the phase diagram of the SIR model on ADTNs and the optimal condition for the spread of epidemic under the circumstances.",

A key to reaching such a lower threshold of immunization is to find and vaccinate people who, through their behavior, are more likely than average to become infected and to spread the disease further. Fortunately, the very behavior that makes these people important to vaccinate can help us to localize them. Earlier studies have shown that one can use previous contacts to find people that are central in static contact networks. However, real contact patterns are not static. In this paper, we investigate if there is additional information in the temporal contact structure for vaccination protocols to exploit. We answer this affirmative by proposing two immunization methods that exploit temporal correlations and showing that these methods outperform a benchmark static-network protocol in four empirical contact datasets under various epidemic scenarios. Both methods rely only on obtainable, local information, and can be implemented in practice. For the datasets directly related to contact patterns of potential disease spreading (of sexually-transmitted and nosocomial infections respectively), the most efficient protocol is to sample people at random and vaccinate their latest contacts. The network datasets are temporal, which enables us to make more realistic evaluations than earlier studies\u2014we use only information about the past for the purpose of vaccination, and about the future to simulate disease outbreaks. Using analytically tractable models, we identify two temporal structures that explain how the protocols earn their efficiency in the empirical data. This paper is a first step towards real vaccination protocols that exploit temporal-network structure\u2014future work is needed both to characterize the structure of real contact sequences and to devise immunization methods that exploit these.",

According to the empirical results on three real-world temporal networks and a theoretical temporal network for susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models, the temporal Dynamic-Sensitive centrality (TDC) is more accurate than both static versions and temporal versions of degree, closeness and betweenness centrality. As an application, we also use TDC to analyse the impact of time-order on spreading dynamics, we find that both topological structure and dynamics contribute the impact on the spreading influence of nodes, and the impact of time-order on spreading influence will be stronger when spreading rate b deviated from the epidemic threshold bc, especially for the temporal scale-free networks.",

Most previous literature has focused on effects of network topology; few studies have addressed the role of temporal structure. We simulate disease spread using SI and SIR models on an empirical temporal network of sexual contacts in high-end prostitution. We compare these results with several other approaches, including randomization of the data, classic mean-field approaches, and static network simulations. We observe that epidemic dynamics in this contact structure have well-defined, rather high epidemic thresholds. Temporal effects create a broad distribution of outbreak sizes, even if the per-contact transmission probability is taken to its hypothetical maximum of 100%. In general, we conclude that the temporal correlations of our network accelerate outbreaks, especially in the early phase of the epidemics, while the network topology (apart from the contact-rate distribution) slows them down. We find that the temporal correlations of sexual contacts can significantly change simulated outbreaks in a large empirical sexual network. Thus, temporal structures are needed alongside network topology to fully understand the spread of STIs. On a side note, our simulations further suggest that the specific type of commercial sex we investigate is not a reservoir of major importance for HIV.",

A common approach to model time-varying networks is via Markovian random graph processes. This modeling approach presents the following limitation: Markovian random graphs can only replicate switching patterns with exponential inter-switching times, while in real applications these times are usually far from exponential. In this paper, we introduce a flexible and tractable extended family of processes able to replicate, with arbitrary accuracy, any distribution of inter-switching times. We then study the stability of spreading processes in this extended family. We first show that a direct analysis based on Ito\u0302's formula provides stability conditions in terms of the eigenvalues of a matrix whose size grows exponentially with the number of edges. To overcome this limitation, we derive alternative stability conditions involving the eigenvalues of a matrix whose size grows linearly with the number of nodes. Based on our results, we also show that heuristics based on aggregated static networks approximate the epidemic threshold more accurately as the number of nodes grows, or the temporal volatility of the random graph process is reduced. Finally, we illustrate our findings via numerical simulations.",

            "summary": "After carefully reviewing the papers relevant to your query on **static random network epidemic SIR threshold aggregation temporal**, I provide below an integrated scientific summary focusing on the role of temporal dynamics, aggregation of temporal networks into static networks, and epidemic threshold in SIR models on random or heterogeneous contact networks.\n\n---\n\n### Research Context and Key Concepts\n\n- Epidemic thresholds determine critical conditions (e.g., transmission rate) beyond which an infectious disease outbreak becomes an epidemic.  \n- Classical epidemic models (SIR, SIS) often assume **static networks**, where contacts are fixed over time with a defined topology (e.g., Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi, random regular networks).  \n- However, **real-world contacts are temporal**, with links activating and deactivating over time, showing memory, burstiness, and heterogeneity.  \n- Aggregating temporal contacts into static networks (e.g., over a time window) facilitates analysis but neglects temporal ordering and correlations that affect epidemic spread and thresholds.  \n- Modeling frameworks combining static backbones with activity-driven or temporal random networks have been proposed to capture persistent contacts alongside temporally intermittent ones.  \n\n---\n\n### Synthesis of Findings:\n\n1. **Static Backbone and Activity-Driven Temporal Overlay (Nadini et al., 2020)**  \n   - Extends classical activity-driven networks (ADNs) by superimposing them onto a **static backbone network** (e.g., Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi or random regular). The backbone represents persistent contacts, while the activity-driven overlay models time-varying contacts.  \n   - The epidemic dynamics depend on the relative balance between the static and temporal links, modulated by behavioral changes (adaptive activity based on health status).  \n   - A **mean-field theoretical framework** predicts epidemic thresholds for SIS and SIR models on this coupled temporal-static structure.  \n   - Key insight: Epidemic thresholds are shaped jointly by static network parameters (degree distribution, backbone density) and activity-driven parameters (activity rates), reflecting a more realistic combination of persistent and transient contacts.  \n   - Citation: Nadini et al., *IEEE Trans. on Network Science and Engineering*, 2020, DOI:10.1109/TNSE.2018.2885483\n\n2. **Impact of Temporal Connectivity and Memory on SIR Thresholds (Kim et al., 2019)**  \n   - Studies how temporal features such as **nodal activity heterogeneity** and **memory (link persistence)** influence the SIR epidemic threshold in **modified activity-driven temporal networks with memory (ADTN)**.  \n   - Strong memory (repeated contacts) inhibits broad epidemic spread by localizing infection, effectively increasing epidemic thresholds.  \n   - High heterogeneity in node activity lowers thresholds, facilitating initial outbreak but limiting the final epidemic size\u2014a trade-off between speed of spread and total infections.  \n   - Aggregated degree distributions approximate static network thresholds but lose important temporal correlations affecting spreading dynamics.  \n   - Citation: Kim et al., *Eur. Phys. J. B*, 2019, DOI:10.1140/epjb/e2019-100159-1\n\n3. **Temporal Correlations vs. Static Network Approximations (Ogura and Preciado, 2015)**  \n   - Present a theoretical framework analyzing **stability (and thresholds) of spreading processes over time-varying networks** modeled by Markovian random graphs and their extensions allowing arbitrary inter-switching times.  \n   - Show that direct eigenvalue-based stability analysis on the full temporal system is computationally hard (grows exponentially with edges), but approximate criteria using spectral properties of aggregated static network matrices become accurate under certain conditions, such as:  \n     - Large network size  \n     - Low temporal volatility (slow switching)  \n   - This justifies the use of **aggregated static networks as proxies for temporal networks** in estimating epidemic thresholds when temporal variability is low or networks large.  \n   - Citation: Ogura and Preciado, *IEEE Trans. on Network Science and Engineering*, 2015, DOI:10.1109/TNSE.2016.2516346\n\n4. **Empirical Evidence: Temporal Structures Affect Threshold and Outbreak Size (Rocha et al., 2010)**  \n   - Simulations on an empirical sexual contact network show that temporal correlations accelerate early outbreaks, yet network topology and contact rate heterogeneity dominate the final epidemic size and threshold.  \n   - Epidemic thresholds in temporal networks can be well-defined but differ quantitatively from static network approximations, underscoring the need to consider temporal ordering and burstiness.  \n   - Citation: Rocha et al., *PLoS Computational Biology*, 2010, DOI:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001109\n\n5. **Vaccination Strategies Leveraging Temporal Network Information (Lee et al., 2010)**  \n   - Propose immunization protocols exploiting temporal information, such as recent contact patterns, rather than relying solely on static contact network centralities.  \n   - This highlights the importance of temporal contacts and their aggregation in designing control strategies and understanding effective epidemic thresholds relative to static approximations.  \n   - Citation: Lee et al., *PLoS ONE*, 2010, DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0036439\n\n---\n\n### Integrative Discussion on Epidemic Thresholds in Static vs. Temporal Networks with Aggregation\n\n- **Epidemic threshold in static random networks (e.g., Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi, random regular) is classically tied to the inverse of the largest eigenvalue or average degree (degree distribution moments).**  \n- When temporal dynamics are superimposed, **aggregation over the temporal dimension yields a weighted static network whose structure heavily influences threshold estimates.** But temporal correlations like burstiness, memory, and order of contacts can either raise or lower the effective threshold compared to purely aggregated networks.  \n\n- **Models combining static backbones with temporal activity-driven overlays allow studying the co-existence of stable persistent connections and ephemeral contacts.** This hybrid model reflects more realistic social systems and enables theoretical threshold derivation through mean-field approximations and MMCA methods.\n\n- **Temporal heterogeneity and memory can inhibit or facilitate spreading:** Strong memory/local repeated contacts localize contagion (increasing thresholds), while highly active hubs decrease thresholds facilitating outbreak.\n\n- **Approximate stability criteria based on aggregated static networks become more accurate with increasing network size or decreasing temporal volatility.** This suggests aggregation is a useful but approximate tool; detailed temporal data is needed for precision.\n\n- **Empirical and simulation evidence confirm that temporal network features accelerate initial outbreaks, modulate epidemic size, and significantly impact thresholds compared to static assumptions.**\n\n---\n\n### Summary Answer to Your Query\n\nThe integration of **static random network structures (Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi, random regular) with temporal contact dynamics** through **activity-driven models with aggregation approaches** provides a powerful framework for analyzing SIR epidemic thresholds. The presence of a static backbone captures persistent contacts, while temporal activity-driven components represent intermittent contacts. Analytical mean-field theories and spectral analysis establish epidemic thresholds considering this interplay.\n\nAggregation of temporal networks into static weighted networks facilitates threshold estimation but may overlook critical temporal correlations. The epidemic threshold in such aggregated networks depends on the degree distribution and node activity heterogeneity; however, temporal features such as memory and burstiness can alter outbreak size, speed, and threshold.\n\nFinally, the accuracy of approximating epidemic thresholds via aggregation improves with network size and reduced temporal fluctuations, but detailed temporal modeling provides better predictive power for control strategies.\n\n---\n\n### Key References\n\n- Nadini et al.
