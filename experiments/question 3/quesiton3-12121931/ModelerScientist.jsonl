In our setting the network is built as follows: in every time step every node “activates” with probability α = 0.1; when active a node creates m = 2 links (to nodes chosen uniformly at random). Thus in any given time step an individual may produce contacts in two ways:\\n\\u2003• by “calling” others when it is active, and\\n\\u2003• by “being called” when someone else is active.\\nA key observation is that on average an individual “calls” m links when active and, \\nsince any given node is chosen by someone else with probability proportional to 1/(N – 1), one may show that the average number of links incident on any node (i.e. the mean degree) in one step is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003⟨k⟩ = m α + m α = 2 m α.\\n\\n(One “m α” arising from the probability of being active and creating m links, and one “m α” from being selected by some other active node: note that in an activity–driven network random activations yield symmetry between these two “directions”.)\\n\\nA common (linear‐regime) approximation is that the number of secondary infections produced by an infected node is given by the product of the transmission “intensity” per contact and the number of contacts made while the node is infectious. More precisely, if the infection “acts” along every available link at rate β per unit time, and the average infectious period is T = 1/γ, then one has approximately\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ ≈ (β T) ⋅ (number of contacts per unit time)\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003= (β/γ) ⋅ (2 m α).\\n\\nThus, to have R₀ = 3 on our temporal network we set\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003(β/γ) (2 m α) = 3\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003⟹\\u2003\\u2003β/γ = 3/(2 m α).\\n\\nPlugging in m = 2 and α = 0.1 gives\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003β/γ = 3/(2×2×0.1) = 3/0.4 = 7.5.\\n\\nSo, for the temporal network, one may choose any pair (β, γ) whose ratio is 7.5. For instance, one might set γ = 1 (which means an average infectious period of 1 time step) and β = 7.5 per time step.\\n\\nNow let’s consider the time-aggregated static counterpart. Typically one “aggregates” the network by taking a snapshot (or summing over the same time interval as the infection period) so that the links that occur during that interval are “frozen” into a static network. If one aggregates over one time step (or over a time window corresponding to the infectious period), then the average degree of the static network is essentially the same as the instantaneous one:\\n\\u2003\\u2003⟨k_static⟩ = 2 m α.\\n\\nOn a static homogeneous network, and in the early stages of an epidemic (so that correlations can be neglected), the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infectious node is proportional to its number of contacts (its degree) times the chance that an infection is transmitted before recovery. Under the standard “mass–action” or “chain–binomial” approximation, if transmission along a link is “weak” so that the probability of transmission is roughly (β/γ) (again assuming β is small enough or the time step is short and/or using a linearization), one has similarly\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀_static ≈ (β/γ) · (2 m α).\\n\\nThus, to have R₀_static = 3 in the static case you obtain exactly the same constraint: \\n\\u2003\\u2003β/γ = 3/(2 m α) = 7.5.\\n\\nOne may then use the same choices (e.g. γ = 1, β = 7.5) for the static aggregated network as long as the aggregation window is chosen in a way that is consistent with the infectious period. (Note that if you aggregate over a much longer time than the infectious period, the “density” of links accumulates and one would have to reinterpret the meaning of transmission probabilities.)\\n\\nIn summary, for both the temporal network and its time–aggregated static counterpart (aggregated over an appropriate time scale) the derivation shows that one should choose the parameters so that\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003β/γ = 3/(2·2·0.1) = 7.5.\\n\\nFor example, setting γ = 1 (unit recovery rate per time step) and β = 7.5 per time step will yield R₀ = 3. \\n\\nThis derivation rests on the fact that in these networks the mean degree per time step is 2 m α, which essentially tells you “how many contacts” are available for transmission when you multiply by the product (β/γ).Below is a concise explanation of how one can validate the theoretical derivation through simulation on a static network:\\n\\n1. Build a static network that is the time-aggregated version of the temporal network. In our case, if you aggregate the transient contacts over an interval equal to the infectious period, the resulting static network will have an average degree of 2·m·α (here 2·2·0.1 = 0.4 on a per-node basis, note that in larger systems the specific structure may vary, but the mean connectivity is preserved).\\n\\n2. Implement a mechanistic SIR simulation on this static network. Use the parameters you derived (for instance, β = 7.5 and γ = 1 time unit) so that the mathematical prediction R₀ = (β/γ)·(2·m·α) equals 3.\\n\\n3. Validate the derivation by running multiple simulation trials:\\n\\u2003\\u2003• Start with a small number of infectives, and let the epidemic progress.\\n\\u2003\\u2003• Track the number of secondary infections generated by each infected node early in the outbreak to estimate R₀.\\n\\u2003\\u2003• Alternatively, analyze the early exponential growth rate of the infected population and compare it with the rate expected from the reproduction number R₀ = 3.\\n\\u2003\\u2003• Compare the final epidemic sizes and outbreak probabilities to assess if the behavior is consistent with the theory.\\n\\nIn summary, by simulating SIR dynamics on the static network created via aggregation across an appropriate time window and using the derived parameters, you can check that the effective reproduction number measured in the simulation is indeed close to 3. This provides a validation of the theoretical derivation used for both the temporal and static cases.Both models are calibrated to have the same “early‐epidemic” reproduction number (R₀ = 3), but because of the differences in how the contacts are organized over time, the realized outbreaks differ in subtle, yet important ways.\\n\\n1. In the static (aggregated) network, every link present over the infectious period is “available” for transmission without any timing restrictions. This means that once the aggregated network is built with an average degree ⟨k⟩ = 2mα = 0.4, an infected node has the possibility to repeatedly attempt transmission across an edge until recovery. As a result, the static network typically exhibits a larger probability that an initial infection “finds” its way into the giant connected component and, when it does, it will infect a larger fraction of the network. In other words, both the outbreak probability (i.e. the probability that a single infection leads to a “macroscopic” outbreak) and the final epidemic size (the total fraction of nodes infected) tend to be larger.\\n\\n2. On the activity‐driven temporal network, however, contacts are fleeting. Each time step a node is available for transmitting the infection only when it is active or when contacted by an active neighbor. This introduces a causal (or time‐ordering) constraint: even if the average “number” of contacts per unit time is the same in expectation, the opportunities to transmit are separated in time and depend on the stochastic activation of nodes. Thus, some transmission opportunities can “miss” because the necessary contacts do not coincide with the period when an infected node is infectious. As a result, even though the early growth (as quantified by R₀) is the same on average, the chance that an infection “hits” the right sequence of contacts to sustain a large outbreak is lower. Therefore, when simulated:\\n\\u2003\\u2003• The outbreak probability measured from many realizations is expected to be lower on the temporal network.\\n\\u2003\\u2003• For those outbreaks that do occur, the final epidemic size (total fraction infected) is also expected to be somewhat smaller compared to the static aggregated network.\\n\\nIn summary, while both networks are set with β = 7.5 and γ = 1 so that R₀ = 3, the lack of “memory” and causal ordering in the static network makes it “optimistic” for epidemic spread—resulting in a higher outbreak probability and a larger final epidemic size—whereas the temporal network, due to its time-varying, transient connectivity, tends to dampen the spread, yielding lower outbreak probability and smaller outbreak size.To validate the differences in outbreak probability and final epidemic size using a mechanistic epidemic model on a static network, one can follow these concise steps:\\n\\n1. Create the static network by aggregating all transient contacts into a single network with mean degree ⟨k⟩ = 0.4. This network will “fix” all links (that occurred during an infectious period) so that every connection is always available for transmission.\\n\\n2. Implement the SIR model with the derived parameters β = 7.5 and γ = 1. Initiate the epidemic with one randomly chosen infected node and let the simulation run until no infectives remain.\\n\\n3. Run many independent simulations (realizations) to collect statistically reliable data. In each run, record:\\n\\u2003• The final epidemic size (i.e., the total fraction of nodes that eventually become infected).\\n\\u2003• Whether the infection takes off to produce a macroscopic outbreak (i.e., outbreak probability).\\n\\n4. Compare the simulation results with the theoretical prediction. On the static network, because every link is permanently present and can be used continuously, one expects both a higher outbreak probability and a larger final epidemic size compared to the temporal network where contact opportunities are brief and time-ordered.\\n\\nThese simulation outcomes (using the static aggregated network) thus validate the analytical expectation that the static network is “optimistic” for epidemic spread—even though both settings share the same early reproduction number R₀ = 3—by demonstrating higher likelihood and larger magnitude of outbreaks in the static scenario.') \n ======\nNow please create a step by step plan through chain-of-thought ** Focus exclusively on design of the mechanistic model**\nImportant: Your should Solely focus on parametric compartmental model network structure, do not set values for the parameters or initial conditions.", "output": "Step-by-step Chain-of-Thought Plan for Designing the Mechanistic Model\n\nStep 1: Identify the appropriate compartmental structure for the disease\n- The scenario specifies a SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) epidemic model for a generic directly transmitted disease.\n- There are no latent/exposed (E) or additional compartments (e.g., hospitalization, vaccination).\n- Thus, the population should be divided into three mutually exclusive states: S (susceptible), I (infected/infectious), and R (recovered/removed).\n\nStep 2: Define the permitted transitions between compartments\n- Infection: Susceptible individuals (S) can become infected (I) through contact with infectious nodes. This transition depends on network structure and contact process.\n- Recovery: Infected individuals (I) recover and become permanently immune (R), never returning to S or I.\n- There are no births, deaths, or secondary processes (e.g., waning immunity or external importation).\n\nStep 3: Specify the possible states of the population in network context\n- Each node can be in one of the three states at any time: S, I, or R.\n- The aggregation over all nodes gives total counts (or fractions) S(t), I(t), R(t).\n- Network structure dictates the feasible contacts: dynamic edges in the temporal model, static edges in the time-aggregated network.\n\nStep 4: Articulate transition mechanisms and parameter mapping\n- Infection occurs via S-(I)->I (susceptible becomes infected via contact with an infectious neighbor through a present network edge); this is modulated by the per-edge infection rate β and presence of edge (depends on network: temporal vs. static).\n- Recovery occurs independently: I->R, with rate γ per infectious individual.\n- For both network types, these transitions are defined for each node based on their current state and network context.\n\nStep 5: Encode transition rules relevant for both network frameworks\n- For both the activity-driven temporal network and its aggregated static counterpart, the model must formalize the transition rules in terms of parameters (not numerical values), emphasizing:\n    - Infection through dynamic contact network: S-(I)->I with parameter β, with edge presence dictated by current network snapshot (temporal) or static edge set.\n    - Recovery/removal: I->R with parameter γ.\n\nStep 6: Formalize modularity for network-driven simulation\n- The model structure must allow infection events to be mediated by network connectivity at each timestep (i.e., adjacency matrix updates for temporal network, fixed adjacency for static).\n- The compartmental structure must be flexible to interface with both temporally-evolving and static network models, without loss of generality.\n\nStep 7: Prepare concise model schema for downstream implementation\n- List all compartments: [\"S\", \"I\", \"R\"]\n- List all transitions with transition triggers and associated parameters (not values).\n- Ensure clarity on the mechanism: infection occurs only via network-mediated S-(I)->I, and recovery I->R is independent of the network.\n\nSummary:\nThe plan focuses exclusively on the parametric SIR structure mapped onto a network context (temporal and static). It exhaustively identifies:\n- All permissible population states\n- Network-mediated transition pathways\n- Modular transitions and compartment definition for later parameterization and simulation\n- This design ensures the model faithfully captures the interaction between compartmental dynamics and network structure, forming a robust mechanistic basis for subsequent analysis.", "error": null, "no_exec_iter": 0, "no_reflections": 0, "meta": {}}

This transition depends on network structure and contact process.\n- Recovery: Infected individuals (I) recover and become permanently immune (R), never returning to S or I.\n- There are no births, deaths, or secondary processes (e.g., waning immunity or external importation).\n\nStep 3: Specify the possible states of the population in network context\n- Each node can be in one of the three states at any time: S, I, or R.\n- The aggregation over all nodes gives total counts (or fractions) S(t), I(t), R(t).\n- Network structure dictates the feasible contacts: dynamic edges in the temporal model, static edges in the time-aggregated network.\n\nStep 4: Articulate transition mechanisms and parameter mapping\n- Infection occurs via S-(I)->I (susceptible becomes infected via contact with an infectious neighbor through a present network edge); this is modulated by the per-edge infection rate β and presence of edge (depends on network: temporal vs. static).\n- Recovery occurs independently: I->R, with rate γ per infectious individual.\n- For both network types, these transitions are defined for each node based on their current state and network context.\n\nStep 5: Encode transition rules relevant for both network frameworks\n- For both the activity-driven temporal network and its aggregated static counterpart, the model must formalize the transition rules in terms of parameters (not numerical values), emphasizing:\n    - Infection through dynamic contact network: S-(I)->I with parameter β, with edge presence dictated by current network snapshot (temporal) or static edge set.\n    - Recovery/removal: I->R with parameter γ.\n\nStep 6: Formalize modularity for network-driven simulation\n- The model structure must allow infection events to be mediated by network connectivity at each timestep (i.e., adjacency matrix updates for temporal network, fixed adjacency for static).\n- The compartmental structure must be flexible to interface with both temporally-evolving and static network models, without loss of generality.\n\nStep 7: Prepare concise model schema for downstream implementation\n- List all compartments: [\"S\", \"I\", \"R\"]\n- List all transitions with transition triggers and associated parameters (not values).\n- Ensure clarity on the mechanism: infection occurs only via network-mediated S-(I)->I, and recovery I->R is independent of the network.\n\nSummary:\nThe plan focuses exclusively on the parametric SIR structure mapped onto a network context (temporal and static). It exhaustively identifies:\n- All permissible population states\n- Network-mediated transition pathways\n- Modular transitions and compartment definition for later parameterization and simulation\n- This design ensures the model faithfully captures the interaction between compartmental dynamics and network structure, forming a robust mechanistic basis for subsequent analysis.", "output": {"name": "Network-based SIR", "compartments": ["S", "I", "R"], "transitions": {"S -(I)-> I": "beta", "I -> R": "gamma"}, "reasoning_info": "Chain-of-thought and justification:\n- The scenario mandates a SIR compartmental model: S (susceptible), I (infectious), R (recovered/removed).\n- No additional compartments (e.g., exposed, hospitalized, vaccinated) are specified, nor are there birth, death, importation, or waning immunity processes.\n- The only two transitions permitted are (a) network-mediated infection (S-(I)->I, with per-edge infection parameter beta) and (b) recovery/removal (I->R, with independent per-node parameter gamma).\n- For both the temporal and static network versions, infection only occurs if an S node has an I neighbor (dynamic or static edge, depending on network model).

Edges are present only within one time step. In the aggregated static network, edges represent the frequency of contacts observed over the duration equal to the average infectious period, with edge weights encoding this interaction frequency; the static network has the same mean degree (⟨k⟩=0.4).

Simulation protocols for both models were outlined based on this logic. The final EpidemicInfo JSON describes all necessary experimental and model details, so future steps (simulation or intervention planning) have a precise starting point. No unnecessary assumptions were made, and every parameter is justified by the user goal and evidence. Both analytic and simulation literature confirm that the temporal nature of contacts is critical and cannot be substituted by static aggregation if accuracy is required.', mathematic_full_response='We wish to “design” our SIR model parameters (infection‐rate β and recovery–rate γ) so that the epidemic, on average, produces R₀ = 3 new infections per “seed” case. In our setting the network is built as follows: in every time step every node “activates” with probability α = 0.1; when active a node creates m = 2 links (to nodes chosen uniformly at random). Thus in any given time step an individual may produce contacts in two ways:\\n\\u2003• by “calling” others when it is active, and\\n\\u2003• by “being called” when someone else is active.\\nA key observation is that on average an individual “calls” m links when active and, \\nsince any given node is chosen by someone else with probability proportional to 1/(N – 1), one may show that the average number of links incident on any node (i.e. the mean degree) in one step is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003⟨k⟩ = m α + m α = 2 m α.\\n\\n(One “m α” arising from the probability of being active and creating m links, and one “m α” from being selected by some other active node: note that in an activity–driven network random activations yield symmetry between these two “directions”.)\\n\\nA common (linear‐regime) approximation is that the number of secondary infections produced by an infected node is given by the product of the transmission “intensity” per contact and the number of contacts made while the node is infectious. More precisely, if the infection “acts” along every available link at rate β per unit time, and the average infectious period is T = 1/γ, then one has approximately\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ ≈ (β T) ⋅ (number of contacts per unit time)\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003= (β/γ) ⋅ (2 m α).\\n\\nThus, to have R₀ = 3 on our temporal network we set\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003(β/γ) (2 m α) = 3\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003⟹\\u2003\\u2003β/γ = 3/(2 m α).\\n\\nPlugging in m = 2 and α = 0.1 gives\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003β/γ = 3/(2×2×0.1) = 3/0.4 = 7.5.\\n\\nSo, for the temporal network, one may choose any pair (β, γ) whose ratio is 7.5. For instance, one might set γ = 1 (which means an average infectious period of 1 time step) and β = 7.5 per time step.\\n\\nNow let’s consider the time-aggregated static counterpart. Typically one “aggregates” the network by taking a snapshot (or summing over the same time interval as the infection period) so that the links that occur during that interval are “frozen” into a static network. If one aggregates over one time step (or over a time window corresponding to the infectious period), then the average degree of the static network is essentially the same as the instantaneous one:\\n\\u2003\\u2003⟨k_static⟩ = 2 m α.\\n\\nOn a static homogeneous network, and in the early stages of an epidemic (so that correlations can be neglected), the expected number of secondary cases produced by a typical infectious node is proportional to its number of contacts (its degree) times the chance that an infection is transmitted before recovery. Under the standard “mass–action” or “chain–binomial” approximation, if transmission along a link is “weak” so that the probability of transmission is roughly (β/γ) (again assuming β is small enough or the time step is short and/or using a linearization), one has similarly\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀_static ≈ (β/γ) · (2 m α).\\n\\nThus, to have R₀_static = 3 in the static case you obtain exactly the same constraint: \\n\\u2003\\u2003β/γ = 3/(2 m α) = 7.5.\\n\\nOne may then use the same choices (e.g. γ = 1, β = 7.5) for the static aggregated network as long as the aggregation window is chosen in a way that is consistent with the infectious period. (Note that if you aggregate over a much longer time than the infectious period, the “density” of links accumulates and one would have to reinterpret the meaning of transmission probabilities.)\\n\\nIn summary, for both the temporal network and its time–aggregated static counterpart (aggregated over an appropriate time scale) the derivation shows that one should choose the parameters so that\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003β/γ = 3/(2·2·0.1) = 7.5.\\n\\nFor example, setting γ = 1 (unit recovery rate per time step) and β = 7.5 per time step will yield R₀ = 3. \\n\\nThis derivation rests on the fact that in these networks the mean degree per time step is 2 m α, which essentially tells you “how many contacts” are available for transmission when you multiply by the product (β/γ).Below is a concise explanation of how one can validate the theoretical derivation through simulation on a static network:\\n\\n1. Build a static network that is the time-aggregated version of the temporal network. In our case, if you aggregate the transient contacts over an interval equal to the infectious period, the resulting static network will have an average degree of 2·m·α (here 2·2·0.1 = 0.4 on a per-node basis, note that in larger systems the specific structure may vary, but the mean connectivity is preserved).\\n\\n2. Implement a mechanistic SIR simulation on this static network. Use the parameters you derived (for instance, β = 7.5 and γ = 1 time unit) so that the mathematical prediction R₀ = (β/γ)·(2·m·α) equals 3.\\n\\n3. Validate the derivation by running multiple simulation trials:\\n\\u2003\\u2003• Start with a small number of infectives, and let the epidemic progress.\\n\\u2003\\u2003• Track the number of secondary infections generated by each infected node early in the outbreak to estimate R₀.\\n\\u2003\\u2003• Alternatively, analyze the early exponential growth rate of the infected population and compare it with the rate expected from the reproduction number R₀ = 3.\\n\\u2003\\u2003• Compare the final epidemic sizes and outbreak probabilities to assess if the behavior is consistent with the theory.\\n\\nIn summary, by simulating SIR dynamics on the static network created via aggregation across an appropriate time window and using the derived parameters, you can check that the effective reproduction number measured in the simulation is indeed close to 3. This provides a validation of the theoretical derivation used for both the temporal and static cases.Both models are calibrated to have the same “early‐epidemic” reproduction number (R₀ = 3), but because of the differences in how the contacts are organized over time, the realized outbreaks differ in subtle, yet important ways.\\n\\n1. In the static (aggregated) network, every link present over the infectious period is “available” for transmission without any timing restrictions. This means that once the aggregated network is built with an average degree ⟨k⟩ = 2mα = 0.4, an infected node has the possibility to repeatedly attempt transmission across an edge until recovery. As a result, the static network typically exhibits a larger probability that an initial infection “finds” its way into the giant connected component and, when it does, it will infect a larger fraction of the network. In other words, both the outbreak probability (i.e. the probability that a single infection leads to a “macroscopic” outbreak) and the final epidemic size (the total fraction of nodes infected) tend to be larger.\\n\\n2. On the activity‐driven temporal network, however, contacts are fleeting. Each time step a node is available for transmitting the infection only when it is active or when contacted by an active neighbor. This introduces a causal (or time‐ordering) constraint: even if the average “number” of contacts per unit time is the same in expectation, the opportunities to transmit are separated in time and depend on the stochastic activation of nodes. Thus, some transmission opportunities can “miss” because the necessary contacts do not coincide with the period when an infected node is infectious. As a result, even though the early growth (as quantified by R₀) is the same on average, the chance that an infection “hits” the right sequence of contacts to sustain a large outbreak is lower. Therefore, when simulated:\\n\\u2003\\u2003• The outbreak probability measured from many realizations is expected to be lower on the temporal network.\\n\\u2003\\u2003• For those outbreaks that do occur, the final epidemic size (total fraction infected) is also expected to be somewhat smaller compared to the static aggregated network.\\n\\nIn summary, while both networks are set with β = 7.5 and γ = 1 so that R₀ = 3, the lack of “memory” and causal ordering in the static network makes it “optimistic” for epidemic spread—resulting in a higher outbreak probability and a larger final epidemic size—whereas the temporal network, due to its time-varying, transient connectivity, tends to dampen the spread, yielding lower outbreak probability and smaller outbreak size.To validate the differences in outbreak probability and final epidemic size using a mechanistic epidemic model on a static network, one can follow these concise steps:\\n\\n1. Create the static network by aggregating all transient contacts into a single network with mean degree ⟨k⟩ = 0.4. This network will “fix” all links (that occurred during an infectious period) so that every connection is always available for transmission.\\n\\n2. Implement the SIR model with the derived parameters β = 7.5 and γ = 1. Initiate the epidemic with one randomly chosen infected node and let the simulation run until no infectives remain.\\n\\n3. Run many independent simulations (realizations) to collect statistically reliable data. In each run, record:\\n\\u2003• The final epidemic size (i.e., the total fraction of nodes that eventually become infected).\\n\\u2003• Whether the infection takes off to produce a macroscopic outbreak (i.e., outbreak probability).\\n\\n4. Compare the simulation results with the theoretical prediction. On the static network, because every link is permanently present and can be used continuously, one expects both a higher outbreak probability and a larger final epidemic size compared to the temporal network where contact opportunities are brief and time-ordered.\\n\\nThese simulation outcomes (using the static aggregated network) thus validate the analytical expectation that the static network is “optimistic” for epidemic spread—even though both settings share the same early reproduction number R₀ = 3—by demonstrating higher likelihood and larger magnitude of outbreaks in the static scenario.'); if not, provide your reflection and set the revise True\notherwise, if you are satisfied with the result, set the revise_needed=False\n", "output": {"reflection": "The generated MechanisticModel accurately matches the requirements of the scenario described in EpidemicInfo.
