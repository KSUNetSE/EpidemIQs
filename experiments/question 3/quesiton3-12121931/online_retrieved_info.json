        "answer": "Recent research shows that activity‑driven (temporal) networks systematically raise the epidemic threshold and therefore require a larger basic reproductive number R₀ to sustain an SIR outbreak than comparable static networks, because contacts are fleeting and the effective degree of infected nodes is reduced each time step; this effect is quantified in several papers. A 2019 study derived analytical thresholds for SIS and SIR dynamics on activity‑driven graphs and demonstrated that, while global awareness does not alter the threshold in memoryless activity‑driven networks, adding memory or explicit community structure can further increase the threshold, especially in finite systems. A 2021 Physical‑Review‑E article compared the configuration (static) model with an activity‑driven model, showing that for identical average degree the activity model yields a smoother, later rise of the infected fraction as R₀ grows and that the critical R₀ is higher than in the static case. A 2022 arXiv preprint examined evolving networks with varying degrees and highlighted that the dynamic rewiring of contacts lowers the epidemic capability of highly connected nodes, pushing the critical R₀ upward relative to static heterogeneous networks. Most recently, a 2024 arXiv paper presented fast exact simulations of SIR and SIS processes on both static and activity‑driven graphs, providing phase diagrams that confirm the analytic predictions: the static network’s percolation‑based threshold (proportional to ⟨k²⟩/⟨k⟩) is lower than the activity‑driven threshold (proportional to ⟨a⟩ + √⟨a²⟩), so outbreaks occur at smaller R₀ on static structures, while temporal activity‑driven graphs require higher transmissibility or longer infection periods to achieve comparable epidemic sizes.",

Simulations reported in late‑2024 and early‑2025 confirm that, for comparable transmission (β) and recovery (γ) rates, epidemics on activity‑driven networks spread faster and reach larger final sizes than on static networks with the same mean degree, because the time‑varying contacts create transient high‑degree hubs that amplify transmission; conversely, static networks with homogeneous degree require a higher β/γ ratio to achieve the same R₀, illustrating that network dynamics and activity heterogeneity substantially reshape the quantitative value of R₀ and the associated epidemic threshold.",

    "agent_response": "Reasoning through the searches:\n\n1. First search on \"recent papers on epidemic SIR model activity-driven network versus static network R0 effect\" yielded results showing that activity-driven (temporal) networks typically lead to a higher epidemic threshold compared to static networks. This means the basic reproduction number R0 needed for spread is higher in activity-driven networks because contacts are fleeting and the effective connectivity of infected nodes is lower at each time step in the temporal network compared to static. Multiple recent papers including some from 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2024 confirm that activity-driven dynamic networks show a smoother and delayed epidemic spread, with higher critical R0 thresholds compared to static networks with the same average degree. The heterogeneity and temporal rewiring reduce the epidemic spreading capability relative to static networks, which have fixed, persistent connections.\n\n2. The second search specifically targeting \"SIR model R0 comparison activity-driven network static network 2024 2025\" indicates that the basic reproduction number R0 differs quantitatively depending on network assumptions: On static networks it depends mainly on average degree, R0 ~ (β/γ)⟨k⟩, whereas on activity-driven temporal networks, R0 depends on the average and variance of node activity rates, resulting in R0 ~ (β/γ)(⟨a⟩ + √⟨a²⟩). Recent 2024 and 2025 simulation studies show that epidemics on activity-driven networks spread faster and reach larger final sizes than on static networks with the same mean degree due to transient high-activity hubs. Temporal networks require higher transmissibility or longer infectious periods to reach epidemic thresholds equivalent to static ones, but once surpassed, spread can be more amplified.\n\nFinal synthesis:\n- Epidemic SIR models on activity-driven temporal networks require a generally higher R0 threshold to initiate spread compared to static networks due to the time-varying contacts reducing sustained connectivity.\n- The critical epidemic threshold depends on the first two moments of the activity distribution in temporal networks, contrasting with average degree in static networks.\n- Though harder to initiate, once the threshold is exceeded, epidemics in temporal (activity-driven) networks can spread faster and to a larger portion of the population than on equivalent static networks.\n- Recent papers from 2019 through 2025, including analytical studies, simulations, and fast exact numerical approaches, confirm these results.\n- The presence of memory, community structure, or heterogeneity in activity can raise or modify the epidemic threshold further.\n- Static networks experience lower critical R0 values but may show more abrupt epidemic transitions. Temporal networks smooth this transition.\n\nFinal Answer:\nRecent research up to 2025 shows that epidemic SIR models on activity-driven temporal networks have a fundamentally different R0 effect compared to static networks. Activity-driven networks impose a higher epidemic threshold (higher critical R0) due to the fleeting nature of contacts reducing the effective connectivity of infectious nodes at any time, requiring greater transmissibility or infectious period to sustain an epidemic. The critical R0 on activity-driven networks depends on activity heterogeneity (first and second moments of node activity rates), whereas on static networks it relies on average degree. Simulations indicate that, despite a higher threshold, epidemics may ultimately spread faster and infect a larger fraction in temporal networks because of dynamically created transient hubs. Heterogeneity, memory, and network evolution significantly influence these results. Therefore, in epidemic modeling, incorporating time-varying activity-driven networks provides a more realistic and nuanced understanding of R0 and thresholds than static network assumptions, informing better epidemic control and prediction strategies. Key recent papers from 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2024-2025 support these conclusions with analytical and computational evidence."
