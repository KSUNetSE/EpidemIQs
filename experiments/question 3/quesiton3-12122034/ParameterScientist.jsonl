Disease transmission is parameterized to achieve R0=3, with a recovery rate gamma=1 and infection rate beta=7.5 per unit time, i.e., beta/gamma = 7.5, as analytically derived for this activity-driven setting. The same infection parameters are used for both temporal and aggregated network models. \\n\\nThe mechanistic model to use is as follows: For the activity-driven network, at each discrete time step, infectious nodes participate in both active (initiated) and passive (received) contacts, with infection probability per contact beta and recovery probability gamma per time step. In the aggregated static network, each node maintains fixed neighbors (average degree ≈ 2mα=0.4) with edge weights proportional to cumulative interaction frequency (edge weights ≈ 1/gamma = 1 for this setup), and transmission attempts occur across these edges with probability beta/gamma. Both models are simulated under the same initial condition: at time t=0, a single randomly chosen node is infected; the rest are susceptible. The process proceeds until no infected individuals remain. The simulation compares final epidemic size, time to peak, and early outbreak probability between temporal and static network settings.\\n\\nBased on literature and analytical studies, temporal activity-driven networks exhibit higher epidemic thresholds, slower and smaller outbreaks, and a lower probability of large outbreaks than their static aggregated counterparts when using these parameters. Memory (correlated contacts or repeated ties) would further amplify these effects in the temporal network, whereas the static network, by aggregating over time, generally overestimates epidemic risk. \\n\\nInitial state for simulation: 1 infected node (chosen at random); 999 susceptible.

When a node is active it creates m edges (i.e. it “reaches out” to m other nodes chosen uniformly at random). In addition, even when a node is not active it may receive contacts from other active nodes. In the limit of a large network, the probability that any given node is chosen by an active node is m/N, and since there are approximately αN active nodes at each time step, an arbitrary node will receive on average\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003(m/N) × (αN) = mα\\n\\ncontacts from others per time step.\\n\\nThus, if a node is infected, then during a single time step it is “involved” in two types of infectious contacts:\\n1. It may become active (with probability α) and then it creates m contacts.\\n2. It may be reached by other active nodes (on average mα contacts).\\n\\nSince the epidemic is in its early stages (or we are computing the average number of secondary infections produced by one infected individual), we assume that nearly all the neighbors are susceptible.

(Notice that here we have “doubled” the factor mα by recognizing that whether you are the one making or receiving the contact, the epidemic may spread along the edge.)\\n\\nIf we assume that the average duration of the infectious period is 1/γ time steps, then the total number of secondary infections generated by one infected individual (the basic reproduction number R₀) is given by\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = β × (total contacts per time step) × (infectious period)\\n\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003 = β · (2mα) · (1/γ).\\n\\nThat is, we obtain the relation\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = (2mαβ) / γ.\\n\\nRearranging gives the relation between β and γ:\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003β / γ = R₀ / (2mα)\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003(1)\\n\\nWith the numbers given:\\n\\u2003\\u2003N = 1000 (which, in our derivation, only ensures the “large-network” limit),\\n\\u2003\\u2003α = 0.1,\\n\\u2003\\u2003m = 2,\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = 3.\\nSubstitute these values into (1):\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003β / γ = 3 / (2 × 2 × 0.1) = 3 / (0.4) = 7.5.\\n\\nThis means that the ratio β:γ must be 7.5:1.

Here’s a concise plan:\\n\\n1. Model construction:\\n\\u2003• Construct a static network (for example, an Erdős–Rényi or configuration model) whose average degree approximates the time‐aggregated number of contacts in the temporal network. In our derivation, each node is involved in about 2mα contacts per time step.\\n\\u2003• Ensure that the static network’s degree distribution reflects the average connectivity (i.e., average degree ≈ 2mα per time step, aggregated over the infectious period).\\n\\n2. Epidemic simulation:\\n\\u2003• Use standard SIR rules on this static network.\\n\\u2003• Set the infection rate β and recovery rate γ to satisfy β = (R₀ · γ)/(2mα). For instance, with γ = 1 and R₀ = 3, choose β = 7.5.\\n\\u2003• Infect a randomly chosen set of nodes (often starting with one index case) and simulate the spread in discrete time steps.\\n\\n3. Validation:\\n\\u2003• For each simulation run, measure the average number of secondary infections produced by an infected node (i.e., estimate R₀).\\n\\u2003• Repeat over many realizations and compare the empirical R₀ with the expected value of 3.\\n\\u2003• Additionally, you can consider comparing the epidemic curves (e.g., cumulative number of infected) with predictions from an ODE SIR model using these parameter values.\\n\\nThis approach validates the derived relation by confirming that the simulation over the static network reproduces the expected reproduction number R₀ under the same parameter set, despite the original temporal dynamics.Below is a concise answer with the key points and assumptions:\\n\\n─────────────────────────────  \\nAnswer:\\n\\nIn the temporal model, one shows that during each time‐step an infected node “generates” 2mα contacts. With an average infectious period 1/γ, the expected total number of opportunities to transmit is (2mα)/γ, so that under a “per‐contact” transmission probability (which is small) the basic reproduction number is\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ ≈ (β · 2mα)/γ.\\n\\nThus, to have R₀ = 3 one must have\\n\\n\\u2003\\u2003β/γ = R₀/(2mα).\\n\\nWith m = 2 and α = 0.1 this means β/γ = 3/0.4 = 7.5. (For example, you might set γ = 1 and β = 7.5.)\\n\\n─────────────────────────────  \\nFor a time‐aggregated static network that “compresses” the temporal contact history into edge weights – where an edge’s weight represents the cumulative number of contacts over the infectious period – one generally proceeds as follows:\\n\\n1. Rather than using the instantaneous contact rate, you build an aggregated network over a time window of length T = 1/γ. In a “union” network in which each node’s neighbors are the distinct nodes contacted at least once during the infectious period, the average degree (kₐ₉g) is typically larger than the instantaneous average (which is 2mα) if contacts occur with new individuals at each time step. (In many studies the aggregation is done so that the static network has the same distinct–neighbor structure as the instantaneous network; this is an assumption that downplays repeated contacts.)\\n\\n2. In the static network the transmission from an infectious node to a susceptible neighbor happens via the edge with cumulative “force of infection” that depends on the weight w. If we denote the effective probability that infection is transmitted along an edge by\\n\\u2003\\u2003T_edge = 1 – exp(–β_static · w),\\nthen under the (often adopted) “low‐rate” or “locally tree–like” approximation T_edge ≈ β_static · w. In many cases one can “renormalize” the transmission process so that\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ = kₐ₉g · T_edge.\\nIf the network is constructed such that its average (distinct) degree is made equal to the instantaneous value 2mα, then one must “recover” the effect of repeated contacts by setting w so that on average w ≈ 1/γ (since over the infectious period the infected node “sees” 2mα/γ contacts which, if dispersed over 2mα neighbors, gives an average weight 1/γ). In that case,\\n\\u2003\\u2003T_edge = 1 – exp(–β_static/γ)\\u2003≈ β_static/γ\\u2003 (for small β_static/γ)\\nand hence\\n\\u2003\\u2003R₀ ≈ (2mα)·(β_static/γ).\\nThus, to achieve R₀ = 3 in the static, time‐aggregated representation you must choose\\n\\u2003\\u2003β_static/γ = 3/(2mα),\\nor\\u2003\\u2003β_static = (R₀ · γ)/(2mα)\\u2003\\u2003\\u2003(with m = 2 and α = 0.1, β_static = 7.5 if γ = 1).\\n\\n─────────────────────────────  \\nKey assumptions and differences:\\n\\n• In the temporal model, contacts are “re‐sampled” at every time step. An infected node makes on average 2mα contacts per time step, and these contacts are independent across time.\\n  \\n• In the aggregated static model the network is fixed and each edge carries a weight indicating how many interactions occurred on that link during the infectious period. (Here the transmission is “lumped” into a single effective chance per edge.) To be consistent with the temporal picture one must either (a) let the aggregated network’s average degree be that of the union of all distinct contacts (which is generally larger than 2mα) or (b) if one “forces” the aggregated network’s degree to be 2mα then assign weights with average 1/γ.\\n  \\n• Under the “low‐rate” approximation both approaches yield the same relation: β/γ = R₀/(2mα) (i.e. 7.5 in our example); however, the static network formulation “hides” the fact that in the temporal case multiple independent transmission opportunities occur over time.\\n\\n─────────────────────────────  \\nThus, with proper interpretation, both the temporal and the aggregated static models yield the requirement that the ratio β⁄γ be 7.5 in order to achieve R₀ = 3. In practice, when simulating on a time‐aggregated (weighted) network, one must make sure that the edge weights correctly capture the cumulative interaction frequency – that is, the mean weight should be about 1/γ – so that the effective per–edge transmissibility (T_edge ≈ β_static/γ) and hence R₀ = (2mα)·(β_static/γ) match the temporal scenario.\\n\\n─────────────────────────────  \\nFinal answer in short:\\n\\n• In the temporal model, one sets\\u2003\\u2003β = (R₀·γ)/(2mα); for m = 2, α = 0.1, and (say) γ = 1, this gives β = 7.5.\\n  \\n• In a corresponding time–aggregated static network (with edge weights equal to the number of interactions accrued over the infectious period), one must (i) either construct the network so that its “distinct”‐neighbors average is 2mα and then assign edge weights with average 1/γ, or (ii) work with the full cumulative contacts. In either case, under the low–rate approximation the effective transmission probability per edge becomes T_edge ≈ (β_static/γ), so that matching R₀ requires\\u2003\\u2003β_static/γ = R₀/(2mα), i.e. the same ratio as in the temporal model.\\n\\nThus, both formulations lead to the condition β/γ = 7.5, but the static network simulation must carefully incorporate the cumulative contact information via the edge weights to capture the multiple transmission opportunities present in the temporal dynamics.A concise plan to validate the theoretical prediction with epidemic simulations on a static network is as follows:\\n\\n1. Build a static network that either:\\n\\u2003• Uses the same distinct-neighbor structure as the instantaneous (temporal) network (i.e., average degree ≈ 2mα), and then assigns each edge a weight equal to the average number of interactions per infectious period (≈\\xa01/γ),\\nor\\n\\u2003• Directly constructs a weighted network where edge weights represent cumulative interaction frequencies gathered from the temporal dynamics.\\n\\n2. Assign transmissibility along an edge by using the effective probability T_edge = 1 – exp(–β_static × w). In the limit of small β_static × w, this approximates to T_edge ≈ (β_static/γ) since w averages about 1/γ. Choose β_static and recovery rate γ so that β_static/γ = R₀/(2mα) (e.g., with m = 2, α = 0.1, and γ = 1, then β_static must equal 7.5).\\n\\n3. Simulate the SIR dynamics on the network:\\n\\u2003• Infect one (or a small number of) node(s) as the seed.\\n\\u2003• At each (discrete) time step, for every infected node, attempt transmission along each edge with probability T_edge.\\n\\u2003• Recover infected nodes at rate γ (or exactly after an average duration 1/γ).\\n\\n4. Validate by running many independent simulation replicates and then:\\n\\u2003• Compute the average number of secondary infections per infectious node early in the outbreak (empirical R₀).\\n\\u2003• Compare the simulation-based R₀ with the theoretical target (R₀ = 3).\\n\\nKey differences from the temporal case:\\n\\u2003• In the temporal network, each time step generates new independent contacts. In the static network, the cumulative interaction is “lumped” into fixed edge weights.\\n\\u2003• The static model compresses repeated contacts into an aggregate transmissibility per link, which under the low-rate approximation gives a similar effective R₀ if weights are appropriately set.\\n\\u2003• Assumptions such as independence of contacts and Poisson-like infections are imposed to equate the discrete interaction probability with a continuous rate model.\\n\\nFollowing these steps ensures that the mechanistic simulation over a static, weighted network reproduces the same effective transmission opportunities as the original activity-driven model, thereby validating the derived relation β/γ = R₀/(2mα).High‐activity nodes in an activity‐driven network act as “superspreaders” because they generate many more contacts than the average node. Seeding the epidemic in such nodes has two main analytical consequences compared to a random seeding:\\n\\n1. Early Outbreak Probability:  \\n\\u2003• A high‐activity node will, by its nature, make many more connections (either by initiating contacts or being selected by others) during its infectious period. This increases its effective individual reproduction number above the network average.  \\n\\u2003• As a result, the probability that the infection sparks a large outbreak is considerably higher when the epidemic starts from a high‐activity node, since its initial spread is more likely to overcome stochastic fade-out.\\n\\n2. Final Epidemic Size:  \\n\\u2003• In SIR dynamics on large networks, the final epidemic size (conditional on an outbreak occurring) is largely determined by the overall parameter values (here, R₀=3) and the network’s connectivity structure.  \\n\\u2003• Even though seeding in a high‐activity node accelerates the early spread and increases the chance of an outbreak, once the epidemic takes off the final size tends to be similar, since it depends on the long‐term depletion of susceptibles. However, if seeded at random, many realizations may peter out in the early stages, resulting in a lower average final size over all runs.\\n\\nIn summary, seeding in high‐activity nodes increases the early outbreak probability (making an epidemic more likely) while, conditional on a large outbreak, the final epidemic size remains roughly comparable between the two seeding strategies. These insights align with known properties of activity‐driven networks, where heterogeneity in node activity plays a central role in both epidemic initiation and early dynamics.Validation via simulation on a static network proceeds as follows:\\n\\n• Build a static (aggregated) network whose average degree is set to the instantaneous contact rate (≈\\u20092mα, here 0.4). If using weighted edges (with weights reflecting cumulative contacts, e.g. ≈\\u20091/γ), ensure that the effective per–edge transmissibility (≈\\u2009β/γ for small β/γ) matches the temporal model.\\n\\n• Simulate SIR dynamics on this network using the same parameters (β = 7.5 and γ = 1) so that the overall R₀ = (2mα)(β/γ) ≈ 3.\\n\\n• Run independent simulation replicates with two seeding strategies:\\n\\u2003– Seed the epidemic at a high–activity (high–degree) node.\\n\\u2003– Seed the epidemic at a randomly selected node.\\n\\u2003For each run, record whether a large outbreak occurs (e.g. final epidemic size above a threshold) and, for successful outbreaks, the final size.\\n\\n• Compare outcomes: Because high–activity nodes generate more contacts, simulations should show that seeding from such nodes yields a higher early outbreak probability (i.e. lower chance of fade–out), even if—for established epidemics—the final epidemic size remains similar.\\n\\nThis approach lets you mechanistically validate that targeting high–activity nodes results in increased outbreak likelihood while the final size is largely determined by the overall parameter R₀.1. In a temporal activity-driven model, you can choose the seeding strategy based on your study’s focus. A common baseline is to seed with a single randomly chosen node, which reflects a minimal introduction scenario. Alternatively, if you wish to explore the impact of connectivity heterogeneity (since high-activity nodes are superspreaders), you might also consider targeting one or a few high-activity nodes.\\n\\n2. When seeding at random, typical practice is to start with a very small fraction of the population—often a single infected node (i.e., 1/1000 or roughly 0.1%) because this minimizes bias and allows you to observe the probability of outbreak emerging from stochastic fade-out. In some studies, researchers might try seeding with a small fraction (for example, 5/1000) to slightly reduce the chance of immediate extinction, but starting with a single seed is standard for assessing early outbreak probability.\\n\\n3. For meaningful comparison with the static aggregated model, you should use an equivalent seeding protocol. That is, if you seed the temporal model with one randomly chosen node (or a specific set such as high-activity nodes), you should seed the static aggregated network accordingly. Using the same initial conditions ensures that differences in outbreak dynamics are due to the network representation (temporal versus aggregated) rather than seeding bias. In summary, using a single—or a very small, fixed fraction of—infected node(s) as the initial seeding in both models is advisable unless you deliberately want to explore the influence of targeting high-activity nodes.Final EpidemicInfo should be based on a minimal, unbiased introduction that captures the stochastic nature of early outbreaks. In practice:\\n\\n1. In the temporal network, the epidemic is typically seeded with a single infected node (≈1/1000 of the population). This minimal seeding provides a baseline to assess the early outbreak probability. Yet, if you wish to compare the effects of heterogeneity, you can also test targeted seeding (e.g., infecting a high-activity node), which tends to yield a higher chance for an outbreak.\\n\\n2. Using random seeding with one node is common; alternatively, one may choose a small fixed fraction (e.g., 5/1000) to reduce the risk of immediate extinction. However, starting with a single seed is standard for studying early outbreak dynamics.\\n\\n3. For validation via epidemic mechanistic models on static, time-aggregated networks, the same seeding strategy should be applied. In other words, if using one randomly chosen node (or a specific high-activity node) in the temporal network, the static network simulation should start with the same initial infected node(s). This consistency ensures that any observed differences in outbreak probability or final epidemic size are attributable solely to the differences in network representations rather than initial condition biases.\\n\\nTo validate via simulation:\\n\\u2003• Construct the static aggregated network mirroring the contact structure (set average degree and edge weights appropriately).\\n\\u2003• Run multiple simulation replicates using the chosen seeding strategy (single node or equivalent small fraction) for both temporal and static models.\\n\\u2003• Compare the early outbreak probabilities and final epidemic sizes across simulations to assess the impact of seeding and network representation.')\n we have created the network with Network specification:\n {'network_details': \"Revised Aggregated Static Network:\\n\\n- The aggregation window ΔT was set so that the average degree 〈k〉 precisely matches the theoretical target for comparison with the temporal network: 〈k〉 ≈ 0.4.\\n- Resulting observed mean degree is 〈k〉 = 0.376 (very close to target, as required for fair scientific comparison).\\n- Second degree moment: 〈k^2〉 = 0.654.\\n- Network is ultra-sparse, as expected.

Disease transmission is parameterized to achieve R0=3, with a recovery rate gamma=1 and infection rate beta=7.5 per unit time, i.e., beta/gamma = 7.5, as analytically derived for this activity-driven setting. The same infection parameters are used for both temporal and aggregated network models. \n\nThe mechanistic model to use is as follows: For the activity-driven network, at each discrete time step, infectious nodes participate in both active (initiated) and passive (received) contacts, with infection probability per contact beta and recovery probability gamma per time step. In the aggregated static network, each node maintains fixed neighbors (average degree ≈ 2mα=0.4) with edge weights proportional to cumulative interaction frequency (edge weights ≈ 1/gamma = 1 for this setup), and transmission attempts occur across these edges with probability beta/gamma. Both models are simulated under the same initial condition: at time t=0, a single randomly chosen node is infected; the rest are susceptible. The process proceeds until no infected individuals remain. The simulation compares final epidemic size, time to peak, and early outbreak probability between temporal and static network settings.\n\nBased on literature and analytical studies, temporal activity-driven networks exhibit higher epidemic thresholds, slower and smaller outbreaks, and a lower probability of large outbreaks than their static aggregated counterparts when using these parameters. Memory (correlated contacts or repeated ties) would further amplify these effects in the temporal network, whereas the static network, by aggregating over time, generally overestimates epidemic risk. \n\nInitial state for simulation: 1 infected node (chosen at random); 999 susceptible.
