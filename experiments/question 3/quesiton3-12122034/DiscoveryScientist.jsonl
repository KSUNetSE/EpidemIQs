Disease transmission is parameterized to achieve R0=3, with a recovery rate gamma=1 and infection rate beta=7.5 per unit time, i.e., beta/gamma = 7.5, as analytically derived for this activity-driven setting. The same infection parameters are used for both temporal and aggregated network models. \n\nThe mechanistic model to use is as follows: For the activity-driven network, at each discrete time step, infectious nodes participate in both active (initiated) and passive (received) contacts, with infection probability per contact beta and recovery probability gamma per time step. In the aggregated static network, each node maintains fixed neighbors (average degree ≈ 2mα=0.4) with edge weights proportional to cumulative interaction frequency (edge weights ≈ 1/gamma = 1 for this setup), and transmission attempts occur across these edges with probability beta/gamma. Both models are simulated under the same initial condition: at time t=0, a single randomly chosen node is infected; the rest are susceptible. The process proceeds until no infected individuals remain. The simulation compares final epidemic size, time to peak, and early outbreak probability between temporal and static network settings.\n\nBased on literature and analytical studies, temporal activity-driven networks exhibit higher epidemic thresholds, slower and smaller outbreaks, and a lower probability of large outbreaks than their static aggregated counterparts when using these parameters.
