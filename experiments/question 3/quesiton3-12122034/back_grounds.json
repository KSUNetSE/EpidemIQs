                    "abstract": "Health information spreads rapidly, which can effectively control epidemics. However, the swift dissemination of information also has potential negative impacts, which increasingly attracts attention. Message fatigue refers to the psychological response characterized by feelings of boredom and anxiety that occur after receiving an excessive amount of similar information. This phenomenon can alter individual behaviors related to epidemic prevention. Additionally, recent studies indicate that pairwise interactions alone are insufficient to describe complex social transmission processes, and higher-order structures representing group interactions are crucial. To address this, we develop a novel epidemic model that investigates the interactions between information, behavioral responses, and epidemics. Our model incorporates the impact of message fatigue on the entire transmission system. The information layer is modeled using a static simplicial network to capture group interactions, while the disease layer uses a time-varying network based on activity-driven model with attractiveness to represent the self-protection behaviors of susceptible individuals and self-isolation behaviors of infected individuals. We theoretically describe the co-evolution equations using the microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA) and get the epidemic threshold. Experimental results show that while the negative impact of message fatigue on epidemic transmission is limited, it significantly weakens the group interactions depicted by higher-order structures. Individual behavioral responses strongly inhibit the epidemic. Our simulations using the Monte Carlo (MC) method demonstrate that greater intensity in these responses leads to clustering of susceptible individuals in the disease layer. Finally, we apply the proposed model to real networks to verify its reliability. In summary, our research results enhance the understanding of the information\u2013epidemic coupling dynamics, and we expect to provide valuable guidance for managing future emerging epidemics.",

                    "abstract": "We consider an epidemic process on adaptive activity-driven temporal networks, with adaptive behavior modeled as a change in activity and attractiveness due to infection. By using a mean-field approach, we derive an analytical estimate of the epidemic threshold for susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic models for a general adaptive strategy, which strongly depends on the correlations between activity and attractiveness in the susceptible and infected states. We focus on strong social distancing, implementing two types of quarantine inspired by recent real case studies: an active quarantine, in which the population compensates the loss of links rewiring the ineffective connections towards nonquarantining nodes, and an inactive quarantine, in which the links with quarantined nodes are not rewired. Both strategies feature the same epidemic threshold but they strongly differ in the dynamics of the active phase. We show that the active quarantine is extremely less effective in reducing the impact of the epidemic in the active phase compared to the inactive one and that in the SIR model a late adoption of measures requires inactive quarantine to reach containment.",

                    "abstract": "Activity-driven networks (ADNs) are a powerful paradigm to study epidemic spreading in temporal networks, where the dynamics of the disease and the evolution of the links share a common time-scale. One of the key assumptions of ADNs is the lack of preferential connections among individuals. This assumption hinders the application of ADNs to several realistic scenarios where some contacts persist in time, rather than intermittently activate. Here, we examine an improved modeling framework that superimposes an ADN to a static backbone network, toward the integration of persistent contacts with time-varying connections. To demonstrate the interplay between the ADN and the static backbone, we investigate the effect of behavioral changes on the disease dynamics. In this framework, each individual may adapt his/her activity as a function of the health status, thereby adjusting the relative weight of time-varying versus static links. To illustrate the approach, we consider two classes of backbone networks, Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi and random regular, and two disease models, SIS and SIR. A general mean-field theory is established for predicting the epidemic threshold, and numerical simulations are conducted to shed light on the role of network parameters on the epidemic spreading and estimate the epidemic size.",

                    "abstract": "An event or a physical activity triggers many nodes for sensing the environment in wireless sensor networks for event monitoring applications. These triggered nodes then transmit the sensed data to the control center. To study the virus propagation behavior in event-driven WSNs, sensor coverage which is a quality of service parameter, can be considered in epidemic model design to get more insight. Existing epidemic models have global characteristics when it is considered a realistic behavior of WSNs. In this paper, a comparative analysis is carried out for spatial correlation feature found in sensor nodes based on sensing range. It is extended version of our recent work. We present analysis using Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model with and without spatial correlation feature. Firstly, we show that the correlated nodes are occurred due to sensing ability for event monitoring applications. These nodes are responsible for transmitting correlated information when an event occurs in the field. A detailed comparative analysis with recent existing SIR epidemic models is presented with results and discussions. A comparison based on basic reproduction number is also discussed. Our Results show the impact of spatial correlation in the behavior of virus spread with time. Comparative study shows the effective use of our model is in designing prevention mechanisms for infection control. It can also be used to study the virus spreading behavior for event-driven scenarios in WSNs .",

In particular, we focus on how the epidemic threshold of the SIR model is affected by the heterogeneity of nodal activities and the memory strength in temporal and static regimes, respectively. While strong ties (memory) between nodes inhibit the spread of epidemic to be localized, the heterogeneity of nodal activities enhances it to be globalized initially. Since the epidemic threshold of the SIR model is very sensitive to the degree distribution of nodes in static networks, we test the SIR model on the modified ADTNs with the possible set of the activity exponents and the memory exponents that generates the same degree distributions in temporal networks. We also discuss the role of spatiotemporal scaling properties of the largest cluster and the maximum degree in the epidemic threshold. It is observed that the presence of highly active nodes enables to trigger the initial spread of epidemic in a short period of time, but it also limits its final spread to the entire network. This implies that there is the trade-off between the spreading time of epidemic and its outbreak size. Finally, we suggest the phase diagram of the SIR model on ADTNs and the optimal condition for the spread of epidemic under the circumstances.",

                    "abstract": "Network-based modelling of infectious diseases apply compartmental models on a contact network, which makes the epidemic process crucially dependent on the network structure. For highly contagious diseases such as Ebola virus disease (EVD), interpersonal contact plays the most vital role in human-to-human transmission. Therefore, for accurate representation of EVD spreading, the contact network needs to resemble the reality. Prior research has mainly focused on static networks (only permanent contacts) or activity-driven networks (only temporal contacts) for Ebola spreading. A comprehensive network for EVD spreading should include both these network structures, as there are always some permanent contacts together with temporal contacts. Therefore, we propose a two-layer temporal network for Uganda, which is at risk of an Ebola outbreak from the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) epidemic. The network has a permanent layer representing permanent contacts among individuals within the family level, and a data-driven temporal network for human movements motivated by cattle trade, fish trade, or general communications. We propose a Gillespie algorithm with the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartmental model to simulate the evolution of EVD spreading as well as to evaluate the risk throughout our network. As an example, we applied our method to a network consisting of 23 districts along different movement routes in Uganda starting from bordering districts of the DRC to Kampala. Simulation results show that some regions are at higher risk of infection, suggesting some focal points for Ebola preparedness and providing direction to inform interventions in the field. Simulation results also show that decreasing physical contact as well as increasing preventive measures result in a reduction of chances to develop an outbreak. Overall, the main contribution of this paper lies in the novel method for risk assessment, which can be more precise with an increasing volume of accurate data for creating the network model.",

                    "abstract": "Most real networks have been found to evolve dynamically. In addition, heterogeneity of interaction strengths and individual\u2019s memory have been proved to be important to affect network evolution in the area of complex networks. Based on a recent extension of the activity-driven modeling framework, i.e. activity-driven model with attractiveness, where individuals are characterized by their activities and attractiveness, we propose a new temporal network model by considering individuals\u2019 memory. Similar to the previous network model, we also investigate heterogeneous distributions and different correlations between the two variables (activity and attractiveness). By numerical simulations, we illustrate the impact of memory on epidemic spreading processes unfolding on the proposed model. We find that, when individuals\u2019 attractiveness is fixed, memory does not cause dramatic change on the epidemic threshold in the SIR process, but it inhibits the epidemic spreading by reducing the infected ratio. While for the SIS process, in the case of uncorrelated and positive correlations between the two variables, memory facilitates the epidemic outbreaks by shrinking the epidemic threshold. When the two variables are negatively correlated, memory does not take obvious impact on the epidemic threshold. Besides, for the two processes unfolding on the network with and without memory, the propagation threshold decreases with the enhancement of the positive correlation, however, it almost does not get much influence from the negative correlation strength. It indicates that for the individuals with same activity, more attractive individuals will promote the disease spread. The findings deepen our understanding of the role of individuals\u2019 memory and their attractiveness in the epidemic spreading process.",
