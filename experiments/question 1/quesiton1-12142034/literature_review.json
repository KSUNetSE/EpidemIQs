We develop a curvature-informed network SIR framework that embeds Forman\u2013Ricci curvature (FRC), a discrete topological descriptor of fragility and robustness, into per-edge transmission. We compute FRC on undirected and directed Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi, Watts\u2013Strogatz, Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert, and Power\u2013Law Cluster networks, and relate curvature to degree, clustering, and betweenness to identify structurally influential nodes and bridge edges. Using curvature-adjusted transmission, we simulate epidemics across topologies and infection rates, then validate predictively with a controlled \u201chidden-truth\u201d benchmark: posterior-calibrated FRC models are compared with advanced centrality-weighted baselines (EdgeBetweenness, Degree, Eigenvector) under identical fit/holdout splits. On heterogeneous graphs (Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert/Power\u2013Law Cluster), FRC improves holdout Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), peak-time accuracy, and final-size proximity. A compact sensitivity analysis over baseline transmission and clustering, with Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC), shows these gains are robust across parameter regimes. Intervention ablations (cases averted vs. budget) further show that vaccinating high-curvature nodes and protecting extreme negative-curvature bridges can outperform EdgeBetweenness targeting at practical budgets. Directed networks exhibit sharper peaks and faster resolution, with strongly negative out-curvature marking putative exporters. In general, FRC provides a principled geometric signal that enhances network epidemic models and yields concrete, topology-aware guidance for targeted vaccination and community-bridge control.",

                    "abstract": "Significance The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 challenges globalized societies. Scientific and technological cross-fertilization yields broad availability of georeferenced epidemiological data and of modeling tools that aid decisions on emergency management. To this end, spatially explicit models of the COVID-19 epidemic that include e.g. regional individual mobilities, the progression of social distancing, and local capacity of medical infrastructure provide significant information. Data-tailored spatial resolutions that model the disease spread geography can include details of interventions at the proper geographical scale. Based on them, it is possible to quantify the effect of local containment measures (like diachronic spatial maps of averted hospitalizations) and the assessment of the spatial and temporal planning of the needs of emergency measures and medical infrastructure as a major contingency planning aid. The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Italy prompted drastic measures for transmission containment. We examine the effects of these interventions, based on modeling of the unfolding epidemic. We test modeling options of the spatially explicit type, suggested by the wave of infections spreading from the initial foci to the rest of Italy. We estimate parameters of a metacommunity Susceptible\u2013Exposed\u2013Infected\u2013Recovered (SEIR)-like transmission model that includes a network of 107 provinces connected by mobility at high resolution, and the critical contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. We estimate a generalized reproduction number (R0 = 3.60 [3.49 to 3.84]), the spectral radius of a suitable next-generation matrix that measures the potential spread in the absence of containment interventions. The model includes the implementation of progressive restrictions after the first case confirmed in Italy (February 21, 2020) and runs until March 25, 2020. We account for uncertainty in epidemiological reporting, and time dependence of human mobility matrices and awareness-dependent exposure probabilities. We draw scenarios of different containment measures and their impact. Results suggest that the sequence of restrictions posed to mobility and human-to-human interactions have reduced transmission by 45% (42 to 49%). Averted hospitalizations are measured by running scenarios obtained by selectively relaxing the imposed restrictions and total about 200,000 individuals (as of March 25, 2020). Although a number of assumptions need to be reexamined, like age structure in social mixing patterns and in the distribution of mobility, hospitalization, and fatality, we conclude that verifiable evidence exists to support the planning of emergency measures.",

                    "abstract": "Brucellosis caused by Brucella abortus is an important zoonosis that constitutes a serious hazard to public health. Prevention of human brucellosis depends on the control of the disease in animals. Livestock movement data represent a valuable source of information to understand the pattern of contacts between holdings, which may determine the inter-herds and intra-herd spread of the disease. The manuscript addresses the use of computational epidemic models rooted in the knowledge of cattle trade network to assess the probabilities of brucellosis spread and to design control strategies. Three different spread network-based models were proposed: the DFC (Disease Flow Centrality) model based only on temporal cattle network structure and unrelated to the epidemiological disease parameters; a deterministic SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model; a stochastic SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model in which epidemiological and demographic within-farm aspects were also modelled. Containment strategies based on farms centrality in the cattle network were tested and discussed. All three models started from the identification of the entire sub-network originated from an infected farm, up to the fifth order of contacts. Their performances were based on data collected in Sicily in the framework of the national eradication plan of brucellosis in 2009. Results show that the proposed methods improves the efficacy and efficiency of the tracing activities in comparison to the procedure currently adopted by the veterinary services in the brucellosis control, in Italy. An overall assessment shows that the SIR model is the most suitable for the practical needs of the veterinary services, being the one with the highest sensitivity and the shortest computation time.",

                    "abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Diseases such as SARS-CoV-2 have novel features that require modifications to the standard network-based stochastic SEIR model. In particular, we introduce modifications to this model to account for the potential changes in behavior patterns of individuals upon becoming symptomatic, as well as the tendency of a substantial proportion of those infected to remain asymptomatic. Methods: Using a generic network model where every potential contact exists with the same common probability, we conduct a simulation study in which we vary four key model parameters (transmission rate, probability of remaining asymptomatic, and the mean lengths of time spent in the exposed and infectious disease states) and examine the resulting impacts on various metrics of epidemic severity, including the effective reproduction number. We then consider the effects of a more complex network model. Results: We find that the mean length of time spent in the infectious state and the transmission rate are the most important model parameters, while the mean length of time spent in the exposed state and the probability of remaining asymptomatic are less important. We also find that the network structure has a significant impact on the dynamics of the disease spread. Conclusions: In this article, we present a modification to the network-based stochastic SEIR epidemic model which allows for modifications to the underlying contact network to account for the effects of quarantine. We also discuss the changes needed to the model to incorporate situations where some proportion of the individuals who are infected remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the disease.",

                    "abstract": "Accurately modeling and predicting epidemic diseases is crucial to prevent disease transmission and reduce mortality. Due to various unpredictable factors, including population migration, vaccination, control efforts, and seasonal fluctuations, traditional epidemic models that rely on prior knowledge of virus transmission mechanisms may not be sufficient to forecast complex epidemics like coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19). The application of traditional epidemiological models such as susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) may face difficulties in accurately predicting such complex epidemics. Data-driven prediction approaches lack the ability to generalize and exhibit low accuracy on small datasets due to their reliance on large amounts of data without incorporating prior knowledge. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a flexible ensemble data-driven framework (Neural-SEIR) that \"neuralizes\" the SEIR model by approximating the core parameters through neural networks while preserving the propagation structure of SEIR. Neural-SEIR employs long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to capture complex correlation features, exponential smoothing (ES) to model seasonal information, and prior knowledge from SEIR. By incorporating SEIR parameters into the neural network structure, Neural-SEIR leverages prior knowledge while updating parameters with real-world data. Our experimental results demonstrate that Neural-SEIR outperforms traditional machine learning and epidemiological models, achieving high prediction accuracy and efficiency in forecasting epidemic diseases.",

Commonly used variations with multiple exponentially distributed variables are more flexible, yet do not allow for arbitrary distributions. We present a new formulation, focussing on the SEIR concept that allows to include general distributions of incubation and removal times. We compare the solution to two types of agent-based model simulations, a spatially homogeneous one where infection occurs by proximity, and a model on a scale-free network with varying clustering properties, where the infection between any two agents occurs via their link if it exists. We find good agreement in both cases.

Risk education and precaution are similar to mass random immunization of epidemic spreading. In this study, the effect of random immunization strategy is evaluated based on the potential-investor\u2013divestor (PID) spreading model in both homo- and inhomogeneous social networks. Fund flux function and system balance function are formulated. The zero point of system balance is used as the collapse point. The peak value of balance, the total number of investors involved and the total amount of principal involved are defined to compare the immunization effects in various scenarios. Mathematical derivation and numerical simulation show that the random immunization takes effect by postponing the peak position of the system balance as well as suppressing the peak values of the system balance. This kind of positive effect helps reduce the scheme\u2019s scale of total number of investors involved and total amount of principal involved. The random immunization is more powerful towards the schemes with small spreading rate than those with medium and high spreading rates. Hence, it is suitable for the concentrated regulation on a large amount of small scale and slow spreading schemes in bulk.",
