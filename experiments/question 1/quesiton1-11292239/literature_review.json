                    "abstract": "Infectious-disease dynamics depend on heterogeneous contact structure, which classical homogeneous-mixing models such as SIR/SEIR cannot capture. We develop a curvature-informed network SIR framework that embeds Forman\u2013Ricci curvature (FRC), a discrete topological descriptor of fragility and robustness, into per-edge transmission. We compute FRC on undirected and directed Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi, Watts\u2013Strogatz, Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert, and Power\u2013Law Cluster networks, and relate curvature to degree, clustering, and betweenness to identify structurally influential nodes and bridge edges. Using curvature-adjusted transmission, we simulate epidemics across topologies and infection rates, then validate predictively with a controlled \u201chidden-truth\u201d benchmark: posterior-calibrated FRC models are compared with advanced centrality-weighted baselines (EdgeBetweenness, Degree, Eigenvector) under identical fit/holdout splits. On heterogeneous graphs (Barab\u00e1si\u2013Albert/Power\u2013Law Cluster), FRC improves holdout Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), peak-time accuracy, and final-size proximity. A compact sensitivity analysis over baseline transmission and clustering, with Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient (PRCC), shows these gains are robust across parameter regimes. Intervention ablations (cases averted vs. budget) further show that vaccinating high-curvature nodes and protecting extreme negative-curvature bridges can outperform EdgeBetweenness targeting at practical budgets. Directed networks exhibit sharper peaks and faster resolution, with strongly negative out-curvature marking putative exporters. In general, FRC provides a principled geometric signal that enhances network epidemic models and yields concrete, topology-aware guidance for targeted vaccination and community-bridge control.",

Commonly used variations with multiple exponentially distributed variables are more flexible, yet do not allow for arbitrary distributions. We present a new formulation, focussing on the SEIR concept that allows to include general distributions of incubation and removal times. We compare the solution to two types of agent-based model simulations, a spatially homogeneous one where infection occurs by proximity, and a model on a scale-free network with varying clustering properties, where the infection between any two agents occurs via their link if it exists. We find good agreement in both cases. Furthermore a family of asymptotic solutions of the equations is found in terms of a logistic curve, which after a non-universal time shift, fits extremely well all the microdynamical simulations. The formulation allows for a simple numerical approach; software in Julia and Python is provided.",

Although it has long been known that such processes take place on social networks, the assumption of \u2018random mixing\u2019 is usually made, which ignores network structure. However, \u2018super-spreading events\u2019 have been found to be power-law distributed, suggesting that the underlying networks may be scale free or at least highly heterogeneous. The random-mixing assumption would then produce an overestimation of the herd-immunity threshold for given R 0; and a (more significant) overestimation of R 0 itself. These two errors compound each other, and can lead to forecasts greatly overestimating the number of infections. Moreover, if networks are heterogeneous and change in time, multiple waves of infection can occur, which are not predicted by random mixing. A simple SIR model simulated on both Erd\u0151s\u2013R\u00e9nyi and scale-free networks shows that details of the network structure can be more important than the intrinsic transmissibility of a disease. It is therefore crucial to incorporate network information into standard models of epidemics.",
