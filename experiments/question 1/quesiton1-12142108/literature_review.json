This paper reviews advancements in mathematical modeling that integrate spatial factors and human movement to enhance our understanding of disease transmission dynamics. Traditional SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) models have been foundational but lack spatial heterogeneity and human mobility considerations. Recent studies have addressed these limitations by developing spatially explicit models that incorporate local interactions, environmental conditions, and human mobility patterns. By synthesizing findings from these studies, we identify strengths, limitations, and future research directions for improving predictive modeling of Zika virus transmission. Key insights include the amplifying effect of local interactions on disease spread and the critical role of human mobility networks in shaping transmission pathways. Addressing remaining challenges, such as refining spatial modeling techniques and integrating real-time data sources, will enhance the accuracy and applicability of spatial disease models in informing public health strategies.",

The disease-free equilibrium, the endemic equilibrium, and their stabilities were examined. The R0 (basic reproduction number) was derived using the Next Generation Matrix method and its sensitivity analysis showed that the birth rate and infectious rate were the most sensitive parameters of R0. The behaviour of exposed individuals at the latent period with varied treatment rates were examined through numerical simulation. From the analysis carried out, the effect of variations of the treatments of latent TB shows that it affects the disease burden. This implies that testing and treatment of latent TB are important in preventing it from becoming infectious. The re-infection rate was examined to see the effect it had both on the recovered and susceptible populations. The study concludes by recommending the extension of the model to an age structured model with co-infection with another respiratory infectious disease like COVID-19. \nKeywords: Epidemiology; Latent TB treatment; Basic Reproduction Number; sensitivity analysis; numerical simulation",

                    "abstract": "From the Black Death to SARS to influenza A (H1N1), communicable diseases have always been among the uppermost problem endangering human health and have caused crises all over the world countless times. Practical relevance of a thorough knowledge of the transmission pathways and related mechanisms of infectious diseases are complex. Investigating the laws of infectious illness transmission mostly depends on the building of dynamic models. Designing corresponding models based on specific transmission mechanisms can more realistically depict the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and provide higher accuracy for parameter estimation. This study suggested an enhanced SEIR model and performed a comprehensive investigation of its equilibrium point and stability, acknowledging that individuals infected with the novel coronavirus are contagious in time of their incubation period. Consequently, an empirical investigation was undertaken utilizing this model to analyze the overall trend of the epidemic in China and the outbreak aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Key model parameters, such as the infection rate coefficient, control coefficient, basic reproduction number, and the particular time at which the effective reproduction number declines to 1, were ascertained by the maximum likelihood estimation approach. The cumulative confirmed case fitting curves for the national pandemic in China and the Diamond Princess outbreak were presented concurrently to further validate the model's efficacy",

                    "abstract": "Initially found in Hubei, Wuhan, and identified as a novel virus of the coronavirus family by the WHO, COVID-19 has spread worldwide at exponential speed, causing millions of deaths and public fear. Currently, the USA, India, Brazil, and other parts of the world are experiencing a secondary wave of COVID-19. However, the medical, mathematical, and pharmaceutical aspects of its transmission, incubation, and recovery processes are still unclear. The classical susceptible\u2013infected\u2013recovered model has limitations in describing the dynamic behavior of COVID-19. Hence, it is necessary to introduce a recursive, latent model to predict the number of future COVID-19 infection cases in the USA. In this article, a dynamic recursive and latent infection model (RLIM) based on the classical SEIR model is proposed to predict the number of COVID-19 infections. Given COVID-19 infection and recovery data for a certain period, the RLIM is able to fit current values and produce an optimal set of parameters with a minimum error rate according to actual reported numbers. With these optimal parameters assigned, the RLIM model then becomes able to produce predictions of infection numbers within a certain period. To locate the turning point of COVID-19 transmission, an initial value for the secondary infection rate is given to the RLIM algorithm for calculation. RLIM will then calculate the secondary infection rates of a continuous time series with an iterative search strategy to speed up the convergence of the prediction outcomes and minimize the maximum square errors. Compared with other forecast algorithms, RLIM is able to adapt the COVID-19 infection curve faster and more accurately and, more importantly, provides a way to identify the turning point in virus transmission by searching for the equilibrium between recoveries and new infections. Simulations of four US states show that with the secondary infection rate \u03c9\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \\usepackage{amsmath} \\usepackage{wasysym} \\usepackage{amsfonts} \\usepackage{amssymb} \\usepackage{amsbsy} \\usepackage{mathrsfs} \\usepackage{upgreek} \\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \\begin{document}$$\\omega $$\\end{document} initially set to 0.5 within the selected latent period of 14 days, RLIM is able to minimize this value at 0.07 and reach an equilibrium condition. A successful forecast is generated using New York state\u2019s COVID-19 transmission, in which a turning point is predicted to emerge on January 31, 2021.",

                    "abstract": "The outbreaks of acute respiratory infectious disease with high attack rates on cruise ships were rarely studied. The outbreak of COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship provides an unprecedented opportunity to estimate its original transmissibility with basic reproductive number (R0) and the effectiveness of containment measures. The traditional deterministic approach for estimating R0 is based on the outbreak of a large population size rather than that a small cohort of cruise ship. The parameters are therefore fraught with uncertainty. To tackle this problem, we developed a Bayesian Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovery (SEIR) model with ordinary differential equation (ODE) to estimate three parameters, including transmission coefficients, the latent period, and the recovery rate given the uncertainty implicated the outbreak of COVID-19 on cruise ship with modest population size. Based on the estimated results on these three parameters before the introduction of partial containment measures, the natural epidemic curve after intervention was predicted and compared with the observed curve in order to assess the efficacy of containment measures. With the application of the Bayesian model to the empirical data on COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship, the R0 was estimated as high as 5.71(95% credible interval: 4.08-7.55) because of its aerosols and fomite transmission mode. The simulated trajectory shows the entire epidemic period without containment measurements was approximately 47 days and reached the peak one month later after the index case. The partial containment measure reduced 34% (95% credible interval: 31-36%) infected passengers. Such a discovery provides an insight into timely evacuation and early isolation and quarantine with decontamination for containing other cruise ships and warship outbreaks.",

For this purpose, we study whether the epidemiological parameters 5 such as the rate of infection, incubation period, and rate of recovery for the COVID-19 disease 6 can be identified from daily incidences and death data. The data are obtained from the Florida 7 Department of Health, which reports the numbers of daily COVID-19 cases and disease-induced 8 casualties. Two mathematical models that consist of a system of ordinary differential equations are 9 used to simulate the spread of the coronavirus in the Florida population. Structural identifiability 10 analysis is conducted on the models to determine whether the models are well-structured to forecast 11 the outbreak. Analysis revealed that the SEIR model is structurally identifiable, while the social 12 distancing model is not structurally identifiable. If the model is structurally unidentifiable, it may 13 not accurately forecast the pandemic, and in turn, may lead to inaccurate control measures. Then, 14 the practical identifiability of parameter estimates that provide the best fit was investigated using 15 Monte Carlo simulations. The practical identifiability analysis revealed that all of the parameters 16 in the SEIR model are practically identifiable, but the parameters \u03b4, \u03b4E , and \u03c1 were found to be 17 unidentifiable in the social distancing model. By comparing two models in this project, we were able 18 to determine the effectiveness of social distancing in preventing incidences and saving lives from the 19 disease in Florida. Furthermore, we consider how people\u2019s behavior changes over time, and how this 20 may affect the rate of disease spread in the population. To represent this, we develop a recipe to 21 determine the time-dependent transmission rate, \u03b2(t), from the data and introduce a methodology 22 of how to accomplish this. 23",

                    "abstract": "Background: The success of social distancing implementations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) depends heavily on population compliance. Mathematical modelling has been used extensively to assess the rate of viral transmission from behavioural responses. Previous epidemics of SARS-Cov-2 have been characterised by superspreaders, a small number of individuals who transmit a disease to a large group of individuals, who contribute to the stochasticity (or randomness) of transmission compared to other pathogens such as Influenza. This growing evidence proves an urgent matter to understand transmission routes in order to target and combat outbreaks. Objective: To investigate the role of superspreaders in the rate of viral transmission with various levels of compliance. Method: A SEIRS inspired social network model is adapted and calibrated to observe the infected links of a general population with and without superspreaders on four compliance levels. Local and global connection parameters are adjusted to simulate close contact networks and travel restrictions respectively and each performance assessed. The mean and standard deviation of infections with superspreaders and non-superspreaders were calculated for each compliance level. Results: Increased levels of compliance of superspreaders proves a significant reduction in infections. Assuming long-lasting immunity, superspreaders could potentially slow down the spread due to their high connectivity. Discussion: The main advantage of applying the network model is to capture the heterogeneity and locality of social networks, including the role of superspreaders in epidemic dynamics. The main challenge is the immediate attention on social settings with targeted interventions to tackle superspreaders in future empirical work. Conclusion: Superspreaders play a central role in slowing down infection spread following compliance guidelines. It is crucial to adjust social distancing measures to prevent future outbreaks accompanied by population-wide testing and effective tracing.",
