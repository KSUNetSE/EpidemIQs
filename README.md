 <h1>  Prompt‑to‑Paper LLM Agents for Epidemic Modeling and Analysis<h1> 
</div>

---
## Project Overview
A multi‑agent LLM framework that can execute an end‑to‑end designed scientific workflow autonomously for network‑based epidemic modeling; from literature discovery and analytical derivations to stochastic simulation, analysis, and LaTeX manuscript generation.

- **Core Idea:** Orchestration of two agent types, *scientist* and *task‑expert*, in five teams to complete the five main scientific phases: **Discovery → Modeling → Simulation → Analysis → Report**.

- **Backbone Models:** We focused on OpenAI models such as: `gpt‑4.1` (Scientists), `gpt‑4.1‑mini` (Experts), `o3‑mini` for MathExpert.  You can use other models from xAI, Anthropic, and Google as long as the model can support tool calling and generation of structured outputs. Ensure you have added  API keys in the .env file.
- We also have tested gpt-4o and grok-3, results are in experiments folder. We advise do not use models with reasoning as Scientists, it seems they do no follow the instructions well! 
- **Simulation Engine:** The `SimulationScientist` has access to [FastGEMF](https://github.com/KSUNetSE/FastGEMF) to perform multi-spread over complex multilayer spread simulations.

- **Highlights:** Low cost per study, full pipeline completion(automous and copilot), final report based on mutlimodal-multisource artifacts generated or retrieved through pipelines

- **Scope:** Our work is currently only for network-based epidemic modeling. We are actively working on a newer design to support a wide variety of methods in the future, having ideazation and getting closer to autonomous research.

##  Features
-  **Multi‑agent orchestration** with structured outputs (Pydantic models) and reflection loops.
-  **Agentic retrieval** (web + literature) feeding math reasoning and code generation.
-  **Network‑aware simulations** on multilayer graphs with FastGEMF.
-  **Autonomous analysis** (numeric + visual) with metric extraction.
-  **Auto‑reporting** to LaTeX/PDF with compile/repair pass.


## Installation and Quick Start
```bash
# 1) Ensure Python > 3.10
# 2) go to your desired directory and clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/KSUNetSE/EpidemIQs.git
# go to the repo directory
cd EpidemIQs  
# 3) create and activate venv
python -m venv .venv 
source .venv/bin/activate # for macos, for windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate  

# 4) install dependencies
pip install -e .

#5) edit the config and pass it the epidemIQs in command line
epidemiqs run now  --config config.yaml    
```

##  API Configuration
the only need you need to modify to run EpidemIQs are .env (for API keys) and config.yaml (for configuration the setup) as follows:
```toml 
## .env
#Ensure you have inserted the following API keys:

semantic_scholar_key = "<PLACEHOLDER>"        # API key for fetching scientific papers -NEEDED
tavily_key           = "<PLACEHOLDER>"        # API key for Tavily search integration -NEEDED
openai_key           = "<PLACEHOLDER>"        # API key for OpenAI model access -NEEDED
```
If you rather to use Grok, GEMINI or anthropic models ensure that you have their API KEYs
```
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
XAI_API_KEY=xai-...
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...
```

This configuration controls how **EpidemiQS** runs experiments, manages model roles, and stores outputs.
It separates **scientific reasoning**, **expert validation**, and **mathematical analysis** into distinct model roles,
allowing reproducible, modular, and configurable workflows.

##  Roadmap
```
- [ ] Broaden to ABM/IB Ms and statistical pipelines.  
- [ ] Full‑paper deep retrieval (PDF parsing & table extraction).  
- [ ] Data-driven forecasting abaility 
- [ ] Memory distillation & long‑run reproducibility suite.  
- [ ] Better LaTeX lint/repair and figure referencing.

```
##  Ethics & Limitations
```
- **Human oversight required.** Agents can make persuasive errors. 
- **Risk of Hallucination:** We detect hallucinated references in the reports. Ensure to double check the results. 
- **Retrieval faithfulness:** Guard against hallucinated references.  
- **Sensitive domains:** Follow biosafety & data‑use policies.  
- **Known issues:** Occasional analysis misreads; see Troubleshooting.
