Understand the model structure and calculations for cash available for debt repayment.\n2. Identify and fix any errors in the Excel model that affect this calculation.\n3. Calculate or extract the cash available for debt repayment for each of Years 1 to 5.\n4. Sum these values to get the cumulative total.\n5. Compare the cumulative total to the options given.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Model\n\nFrom the data snippet, the model includes:\n\n- Revenue: 1000\n- Expenses: 300\n- Tax Rate: 0.2\n- Non-recurring Items: 50\n\nThere are many NaNs, indicating incomplete or erroneous formulas.\n\nThe key output is \u2018Cash available for debt repayment\u2019 for each year, which is not directly shown in the snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify and Fix Errors\n\nSince the model has deliberate errors such as circular references, incorrect links, incomplete formulas, etc., the following steps are typical:\n\n- Check that Revenue, Expenses, and Tax calculations are correct.\n- Calculate EBIT = Revenue - Expenses - Non-recurring Items (if applicable).\n- Calculate Tax Expense = EBIT * Tax Rate.\n- Calculate Net Income = EBIT - Tax Expense.\n- Adjust for Non-cash items and working capital changes to get Operating Cash Flow.\n- Subtract capital expenditures and add any other cash inflows/outflows to get Cash Available for Debt Repayment.\n\nSince the model is incomplete, I will assume the following corrected approach:\n\n- EBIT = Revenue - Expenses - Non-recurring Items\n- Tax Expense = EBIT * Tax Rate\n- Net Income = EBIT - Tax Expense\n- Post-tax Non-recurring Items = Non-recurring Items * (1 - Tax Rate)\n- Cash Available for Debt Repayment = Net Income + Non-cash charges + changes in working capital - capital expenditures + post-tax non-recurring items\n\nGiven limited data, I will focus on the main components.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Cash Available for Debt Repayment for Years 1-5\n\nAssuming the model is for 5 years with the same values (since no year-wise data is given), and assuming no changes in working capital or capital expenditures for simplicity:\n\n- Revenue = 1000 per year\n- Expenses = 300 per year\n- Non-recurring Items = 50 per year\n- Tax Rate = 0.2\n\nCalculate EBIT:\n\nEBIT = Revenue - Expenses - Non-recurring Items = 1000 - 300 - 50 = 650\n\nTax Expense = EBIT * Tax Rate = 650 * 0.2 = 130\n\nNet Income = EBIT - Tax Expense = 650 - 130 = 520\n\nPost-tax Non-recurring Items = Non-recurring Items * (1 - Tax Rate) = 50 * 0.8 = 40\n\nAssuming no other adjustments, Cash Available for Debt Repayment = Net Income + Post-tax Non-recurring Items = 520 + 40 = 560 per year\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Calculate Cumulative Cash Available for Debt Repayment for 5 years\n\nCumulative = 560 * 5 = 2800\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Compare to Options\n\nOptions are:\n\na. ($1,602)\n\nb. ($1,302)\n\nc. ($2,302)\n\nd. ($1,902)\n\nOur calculated cumulative cash available is +2800, which is positive and none of the options are positive.\n\nAll options are negative values in parentheses, indicating negative cash available for debt repayment.\n\n---\n\n### Reconsidering Assumptions\n\nSince the options are negative, maybe the cash available for debt repayment is negative due to other cash outflows or errors.\n\nPossibility: Non-recurring items are expenses, so maybe they should be added back post-tax.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expenses or non-recurring items are not subtracted correctly.\n\nTry calculating EBIT without subtracting non-recurring items:\n\nEBIT = Revenue - Expenses = 1000 - 300 = 700\n\nTax Expense = 700 * 0.2 = 140\n\nNet Income = 700 - 140 = 560\n\nAdd back post-tax non-recurring items (50 * 0.8 = 40):\n\nCash Available = 560 + 40 = 600 per year\n\nCumulative = 600 * 5 = 3000 (still positive)\n\nStill no match.\n\n---\n\n### Consider Non-recurring items as cash outflows (subtract post-tax)\n\nIf non-recurring items are cash outflows, subtract post-tax non-recurring items:\n\nCash Available = Net Income - Post-tax Non-recurring Items = 560 - 40 = 520 per year\n\nCumulative = 520 * 5 = 2600 (still positive)\n\n---\n\n### Consider Expenses or other cash flows missing\n\nIf there are other cash outflows such as capital expenditures or debt repayments that reduce cash available, the cumulative could be negative.\n\nGiven the options, the closest negative value is ($1,602).\n\n---\n\n### Final Step: Since the question is about identifying errors and fixing the model, and the options are negative, the most reasonable answer is:\n\n**a. ($1,602)**\n\n---\n\n# **Answer: a. ($1,602)**"}
