Funding for day to day operations with a commitment fee on issue and no schedule on drawdowns, repayments and redraws\n\nExplanation:  \nA revolving line of credit is a flexible financing option that allows a borrower to draw, repay, and redraw funds up to a certain limit as needed. It is commonly used to support day-to-day operational expenses rather than one-off capital purchases or structured repayment schedules. Typically, there is a commitment fee for having the credit available, but no fixed schedule for drawdowns or repayments, making it ideal for managing working capital fluctuations."}

A lower credit rating than senior tranches and higher associated risk\n\nExplanation:\nIn a Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO), the junior tranches (also called equity or subordinated tranches) are the first to absorb losses if the underlying assets default. Because of this higher risk exposure, junior tranches have a lower credit rating compared to senior tranches. Senior tranches have priority in receiving payments and are therefore considered safer, resulting in higher credit ratings and lower associated risk. Junior tranches, being riskier, typically offer higher potential returns to compensate for the increased risk."}
