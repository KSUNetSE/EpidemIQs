Changes in the Net Working Capital position  \n- Changes in Net Working Capital (NWC) affect the cash tied up in the business. An increase in NWC means more cash is used, reducing free cash flow, and a decrease releases cash, increasing free cash flow.  \n- Therefore, changes in NWC do impact FCFF.\n\nb. A loan amortization payment falling due  \n- Loan amortization payments are principal repayments. FCFF is calculated before financing cash flows, so principal repayments do not affect FCFF.  \n- Therefore, loan amortization payments do not impact FCFF.\n\nc. Interest rate increases on its debt facilities during the year  \n- Interest expense is excluded from FCFF because FCFF is calculated before interest payments (unlevered free cash flow). However, an increase in interest rates affects net income and taxes, but since FCFF is before interest, the direct interest expense does not impact FCFF.  \n- But, higher interest rates can indirectly affect FCFF through tax shield changes, but the question is about direct impact.  \n- So, interest rate increases do not directly impact FCFF.\n\nd. A reduction in the tax rate  \n- Taxes affect FCFF because FCFF is calculated after taxes on operating income (NOPAT). A reduction in the tax rate increases NOPAT and thus increases FCFF.  \n- Therefore, a reduction in the tax rate impacts FCFF.\n\nSummary:  \n- a impacts FCFF  \n- b does not impact FCFF (loan principal repayment is a financing cash flow)  \n- c does not directly impact FCFF (interest is excluded in FCFF calculation)  \n- d impacts FCFF\n\nBetween b and c, which one \"does not act to impact\" FCFF? Both do not directly impact FCFF, but loan amortization payment is a financing cash flow and is excluded from FCFF, while interest rate changes affect tax shield and cost of capital but not FCFF directly.\n\nGiven the options, the best answer is:\n\n**b. A loan amortization payment falling due**  \n\nBecause loan principal repayments are financing activities and do not affect Free Cash Flow for the Firm."}
