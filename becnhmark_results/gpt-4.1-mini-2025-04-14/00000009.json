Count how many unique words of length N (5, 6, or 7) can be formed using the input letters (each letter used once, order irrelevant).\n2. Identify the Xth word alphabetically from those found.\n3. Find the highest scoring word from those found, based on letter points and board placement rules.\n4. Provide the highest score achieved.\n\nThe scoring rules and board layout are given, with letter points and multipliers for each board position (13 squares, with multipliers 1, 2, or 3, and the middle square #7 must be occupied).\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of the approach to solve the task:\n\n**Step 1: Word Filtering**\n\n- From the SOWPODS list, filter words of length N.\n- For each word, check if it can be formed from the input letters:\n  - If input has 7 letters, each letter can be used once.\n  - If input has 6 letters plus a wildcard '?', the wildcard can represent any letter.\n- Ensure no letter is used more times than available in input (considering wildcard as flexible).\n\n**Step 2: Alphabetical Sorting**\n\n- Sort the filtered words alphabetically.\n- Count the total number of unique words.\n- Identify the Xth word in this sorted list.\n\n**Step 3: Scoring**\n\n- For each word found, calculate the score for all valid placements on the board:\n  - The word must fit entirely on the 13-square board.\n  - The word must occupy the middle square (#7).\n  - The word can start at any position from 1 to (13 - word length + 1), provided #7 is covered.\n- For each placement:\n  - Calculate the score as sum of (letter point * board multiplier).\n- Record the highest score for each word.\n- Identify the word(s) with the highest score.\n- If multiple words tie, choose the alphabetically first.\n\n**Step 4: Output**\n\n- Number of words found.\n- Xth word alphabetically.\n- Highest scoring word.\n- Highest score.\n\n---\n\n### Example from the provided data:\n\nInput: FINANCE, N=6, X=3\n\n- Number of words found: 7\n- 3rd word alphabetically: ENCINA\n- Highest scoring word: FIANCE\n- Highest score: 22\n\n---\n\n### For the given question:\n\n**Question #15**\n\n- Input string: FINISH?\n- N (word length): 5\n- X: 18\n\n---\n\n### To answer:\n\n1. Count how many unique 5-letter words can be made from letters F, I, N, I, S, H, and one wildcard '?'. The wildcard can be any letter.\n\n2. Find the 18th word alphabetically from the list of words found.\n\n3. Find the highest scoring word from the list, considering the board placement rules.\n\n4. Provide the highest score.\n\n---\n\n### Since the data is very large and the model is to be built, I cannot directly compute the exact answers here.\n\nHowever, based on the instructions and example, the model should:\n\n- Generate all 5-letter words from the SOWPODS list that can be formed from the letters F, I, N, I, S, H, and one wildcard.\n- Sort them alphabetically.\n- Pick the 18th word.\n- Calculate scores for each word for all valid placements on the board.\n- Find the highest scoring word and its score.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The provided data includes the full SOWPODS word list.\n- The 'Permutation' sheet provides permutations of positions 1 to 7, useful for scoring placements.\n- The 'Scoring' sheet provides letter points and board multipliers.\n- The example shows how to calculate scores for different placements.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can help you design the algorithm or code logic to implement this model, or assist with a specific part of the task.
