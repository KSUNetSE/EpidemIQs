last location and calculate flight cost for the squad (21 personnel).\n\n---\n\n### Example calculation for first game on 2015-05-11:\n\n- Game: Hornets vs Llamas at Pink City\n- Both teams start at Purple City.\n- Flight cost per person Purple City to Pink City = 253\n- Squad size = 21\n- Flight cost per team = 253 * 21 = 5313\n- Total for game = 5313 * 2 = 10626\n- Update Hornets and Llamas location to Pink City.\n\n---\n\n### Repeat for all games in date range:\n\nI will summarize the calculations:\n\n| Date       | Team A    | Team B    | Location    | Team A last loc | Team B last loc

We need to calculate the total flight cost for all teams traveling between venues during the tournament, but with the start and end flights from Green City instead of Purple City.\n4. The flight costs per person between cities are given.\n5. The squad size for each team is given.\n6. The list of games with venues and dates is given.\n7. For each team:\n   - Calculate the flight cost from the start city (now Green City) to the venue of their first game.\n   - Calculate the flight costs between venues for subsequent games.\n   - Calculate the flight cost from the venue of their last game back to the end city (now Green City).\n8.
