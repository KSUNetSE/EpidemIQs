However, this value does not match any of the given options (which are around $198,184,476 to $198,184,484). Given the limited data access and assuming the guaranteed tonnage is at least 75,000 tonnes at $45 per tonne inflated at 2% annually, none of the provided choices match the calculation exactly. Without detailed tonnage data per quarter, it's not possible to pick an exact choice.

According to the waste flow chart and problem notes, the additional gate fees (Rev 3) are charged on the tonnage that is the remainder of 95% authority waste after subtracting the guaranteed waste minimum of 75,000 tonnes. Calculating 95% of total waste gives 74,801 tonnes authority waste, which is less than or almost equal to 75,000 tonnes guaranteed. Hence, no tonnage remains for additional gate fees after adjusting for the minimum guaranteed amount. Therefore, the total tonnage on which additional gate fees are charged (after adjusting for the guaranteed minimum but before adjusting for payment timing) is 0 tonnes.\n\nNone of the multiple choices (which are in the range 79,448 to 79,456) match this calculation, but based on the data and flowchart, the additional gate fee tonnage in the Jan 2018 quarter is 0.\n\nIf the question refers to cumulative or another quarter, please provide clarification or data for that quarter. Otherwise, the answer considering the given data is 0 tonnes."}
