The provided answer options (2,372,322 to 2,372,327) do not match this number exactly.\n\nGiven the variance in extracted dividend values and the provided discrete options, there appears to be some discrepancy either in the model data interpretation or in the question options.\n\nSince the exact dividend paid in 2034 from the financials sheet does not match the options and earlier extraction was found incorrect due to row/column misalignment, the exact choice among given options cannot be confirmed precisely.\n\nRecommendation: The dividend paid in 2034 based on current reread is about $2,156,218 which does not match any given choices exactly.\n\nTherefore, no exact match found; the answer cannot be determined precisely with the available data and question options given discrepancies in readings."}
