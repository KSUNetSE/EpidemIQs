The monthly cash balances remain positive well beyond August 2014. Therefore, the correct answer to the question \"Which month do you forecast Slick Mick's toys will run out of cash?\" is that none of the options (May 2014, June 2014, July 2014, August 2014) indicate running out of cash. The cash remains positive through these months. However, since these are the only options and cash is positive in all, the answer is that they do not run out of cash in these months."}

Use the opening debtor balance ($600,000).\n2. Aiming for a reduction in debtor days implies a closing balance less than opening, but not implausibly low.\n3. Based on the given options and business scale, targeting a closing debtor balance around $560,000 is realistic.\n\nTherefore, the recommended target debtor balance on 30 June 2014 to achieve the KPI of 43 debtor days is option b: $560,000."}
