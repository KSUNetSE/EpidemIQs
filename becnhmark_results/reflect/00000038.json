The maximum total installed systems by June 2015 are 94 small and 67 large systems, which is insufficient to produce generation values in the range of 16 million kWh for the year 2016.\n\nApplying the monthly degradation rate where efficiency after 12 months is 99% of current efficiency, the total electricity generated post degradation by all systems in calendar year 2016 calculates to approximately 881,088 kWh.\n\nThis result is far below the multiple-choice options given (all approx. 16 million kWh), indicating a potential mismatch between the installation data provided and the expected scale of generation.\n\nTherefore, based on the workbook data and operational assumptions, none of the answer choices a) 16,154,168 kWh, b) 16,155,565 kWh, c) 16,153,231 kWh, or d) 16,156,943 kWh is supported.
