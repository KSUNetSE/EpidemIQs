No, Fair Value may include some other value to a buyer that the open market does not recognise thereby making Fair Value greater than Market Value in some cases.\n\nFair Value and Market Value are related but not identical concepts. Fair Value is often defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It may consider factors that the open market may not fully recognize, such as synergies or unique value to a specific buyer. Market Value, on the other hand, generally refers to the price at which an asset would trade in a competitive auction setting.\n\nTherefore, Fair Value can sometimes be greater than Market Value if it includes additional value not recognized by the market at large."}
