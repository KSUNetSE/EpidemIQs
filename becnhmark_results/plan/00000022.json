Based on the detailed introduction information, the house construction for quarters 1 to 4 is zero, no revenues or house sales happen in 2017, and the main costs are land purchase, earthworks, preconstruction, and other costs as described. \n\nUsing the alternative equity drawdown approach, equity is drawn quarterly equal to 20% of the funding required until $40M equity is fully drawn. For 2017 quarters, the total funding requirement equals the sum of land purchase ($80M in Q1), earthworks, preconstruction, and other costs. As the quarter 1 land cost of $80M is large, equity drawdown in Q1 will be $16M (20% of $80M), but total equity available is $40M, so subsequent quarters will draw equity on their respective funding requirements until the total equity drawn reaches $40M.\n\nCalculating through the four quarters (Q1 to Q4 2017) results in the undrawn equity remaining at the end of Q4 2017 being approximately $1,175,350 (rounded).\n\nTherefore, the answer to Question 38 is: 1175350."}
