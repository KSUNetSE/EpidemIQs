This suggests that there may have been a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the data or question.\n\nUpon review, the data we processed is likely more than 6,000 turns or includes game number rows that are being counted as rolls. We need to check and make sure only 6,000 turns are processed correctly.\n\nNext step: Re-examine and properly extract exactly 6,000 turns of 6 dice rolls each, then recalculate the \"High and Often\" score.\n\nProceeding to refine the data extraction and score calculation."}
