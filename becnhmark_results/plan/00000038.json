Therefore, we cannot compute the precise total purchasing and installation costs in AUD. However, the formula to calculate the monthly cost is:\n\nMonthly cost = (Number of small systems * (5000 USD * exchange rate USD to AUD + 500 AUD)) + (Number of large systems * (8000 USD * exchange rate USD to AUD + 500 AUD))\n\nThe sum over all months gives the total purchasing and installation cost. Once the installation data is available, applying this formula will yield the total cost which can then be compared to the provided options:\n\na. $21.0m\nb. $19.5m\nc. $18.5m\nd. $17.0m\n\nSince the installation counts are missing in the data provided, a conclusive answer cannot be derived from the current workbook."}

Given this, it is likely a computational difference or rounding from assumptions, but the closest options are all around 16,154,000 kWh.\n\nSince the options are very close and our model may require some small adjustments, I'd suggest reviewing data inputs or revalidating assumptions. However, based on strict calculation with given data, the computed total generation is around 15,273,081 kWh in 2016."}
