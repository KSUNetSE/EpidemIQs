No, Fair Value may include some other value to a buyer that the open market does not recognise thereby making Fair Value greater than Market Value in some cases. \n\nExplanation: Fair Value is an estimate of the price at which an asset or liability could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction. It may include assumptions, estimates, and information beyond current open market conditions. Market Value is based strictly on open market conditions and observable prices in active markets. Therefore, Fair Value can sometimes be higher than Market Value if it includes additional value recognized by certain buyers. The other choices either misunderstand the concepts or incorrectly equate Fair Value with Market Value or replacement value."}
