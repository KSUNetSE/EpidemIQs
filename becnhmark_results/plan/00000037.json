An overstatement in the company's Balance Sheet. DuPont analysis breaks down Return on Equity into profit margin, asset turnover, and financial leverage, so it can uncover problems with slow moving stock, overgrown costs, and higher than acceptable leverage. However, it is unlikely to detect an overstatement in the company's Balance Sheet because it relies on the reported financial figures without validating their accuracy."}

This is because a revolving line of credit is characterized by flexibility, allowing the borrower to draw down, repay, and redraw funds repeatedly up to a credit limit, often used to manage working capital without fixed repayment schedules. Options a and b refer to more specific or one-off funding purposes, and option d mentions an agreed repayment schedule which is not typical of revolving credit lines."}
