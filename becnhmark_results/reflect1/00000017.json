The complexity and formatting of the Excel file inhibited direct data retrieval for the MMRA underfunding under Profile 4.\n\nTo provide a precise and data-driven answer, the workbook needs to be manually reviewed or accessed with tools that can preserve and interpret the Excel structure more effectively, particularly focusing on 'Calculations' and 'Assumptions' sheets for cash profiles and MMRA underfunding figures.\n\nGiven the current limitation, I recommend reviewing the workbook directly to locate the MMRA underfunding under Profile 4 and select the corresponding value from the options:\nA. $13,980\nB. $13,981\nC. $13,982\nD. $13,983\nE. $13,984\nF. $13,985\nG. $13,986\nH. $13,987\nI. $13,988\n\nThis approach will ensure the answer is accurate and verified from the source data.\n\nIf you can provide details on the location of these figures in the workbook or a clearer snapshot of the relevant table, I can then help extract and verify the answer precisely."}
