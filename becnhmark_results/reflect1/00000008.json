Calculate excess vehicles per depot in Hub 2:\n   - Depot D has 153 excess vehicles (553 vehicles expected vs 400 capacity).\n   - Depot E has 3 excess vehicles (103 vehicles expected vs 100 capacity).\n   - Depot F has no excess (300 vehicles expected vs 400 capacity).\n\n2. Available capacity in Hub 2 depots:\n   - Only Depot F has 100 open spots.\n\n3. Calculate transport costs to reallocate excess vehicles from Depot D or Depot E to Depot F:\n   - Depot D to Depot F round trip transport cost per vehicle: 660 miles * $1.40 = $924\n   - Depot E to Depot F round trip transport cost per vehicle: 580 miles * $1.40 = $812\n\n4. Since these transport costs exceed the $500 penalty, MVC will not choose to reallocate vehicles and will prefer paying penalty for unserviceable vehicles.\n\n5. However, Depot F can still service 100 vehicles, so 100 of the excess vehicles are allocated there without penalty.\n\n6. The remaining vehicles (153 + 3 - 100 = 56) cannot be serviced and thus incur penalty.\n\n7. Total penalty cost = 56 vehicles * $500 = $28,000.\n\nCorrect answer: B. $28,000"}
