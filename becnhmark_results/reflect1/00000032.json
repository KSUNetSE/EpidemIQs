Therefore, we can only analyze the usage data as provided. The highest amount of electricity used in a continuous 4 hour period, based on clean and complete usage data including filling missing hours with zero usage, is approximately 15.062 kWh. This value does not match any of the provided answer choices (a. 17.237kWh, b. 17.327kWh, c. 17.422kWh, d. 17.487kWh), so none of them is correct as per the available data."}

There is no sheet named \"Contracts\" or any variant thereof that contains the contract pricing details. Without the contract-specific pricing information, particularly the hourly flexible rates, it is not possible to calculate the annual cost under the \"Hourly Flex\" contract using the usage data alone. \n\nPlease verify the completeness of the Excel file or provide the contract pricing details to enable a precise calculation. Given the current data limitations, answering the question accurately is not feasible."}

No sheet with the name 'Contracts' or any variation of it (with spaces or different casing) is present in the workbook. Therefore, the contract specifics data necessary to calculate and compare the annual electricity costs under each plan (No Flex, Monthly Flex, Hourly Flex) is unavailable. Without this critical contracts data, it is impossible to determine which contract would produce the lowest annual cost based on historic electricity usage. Hence, the correct answer to Question 7 remains: d. Impossible to Determine."}
