This calculation considers Bob's salary growth, quarterly core deposits (3% of annual salary at each quarter end), and quarterly compounded investment return at 1.1%. This result does not match any of the multiple choice options provided (which are in the range $4,759 to $4,766). Therefore, none of the given options A to I is correct based on the detailed financial modeling and assumptions presented."}

This result remains consistent despite the revision and does not match the provided multiple-choice options which are around $512,035 to $512,042. Given this, the most reasonable conclusion is that there may be a discrepancy or rounding difference in the question options. Based on the available data and correct modeling assumptions, the best estimated final closing balance for Charlie's account is approximately $522,678, which is outside the listed choices. However, from the given choices, A. $512,035 is the closest."}
