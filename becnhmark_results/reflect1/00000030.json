This means there is no decrease in Present Value; instead, there is an increase of about 161,000 Euros.\n\nSince the question asks for the decrease in Present Value due to switching from NPV to XNPV, the correct interpretation is that the Present Value does not decrease at all. Therefore, none of the provided options (a: 179,000 b: 180,000 c: 181,000 d: 182,000) correctly describe a decrease, as the Present Value actually increases.\n\nHence, the accurate answer is that the Present Value does not decrease but increases by approximately 161,000 Euros when using XNPV instead of NPV."}
