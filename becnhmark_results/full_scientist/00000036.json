Fair Value and Market Value are related but distinct concepts. Fair Value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants, potentially including some assumptions about market participant attributes. Market Value is the estimated amount between a willing buyer and seller in an active market.\n\nFair Value may include additional value to a buyer that the open market does not recognize, so it can be greater than Market Value in some cases. The other options are incorrect because they either claim Fair Value is always less than Market Value, equate Fair Value to an asking price, or wrongly equate it to replacement cost, which does not align with standard financial definitions and practices."}
