An overstatement in the company's Balance Sheet. DuPont analysis breaks down Return on Equity into Profit Margin, Asset Turnover, and Financial Leverage. It can reveal problems related to slow-moving stock (affecting asset turnover), overgrown costs (affecting profit margin), and higher leverage (financial leverage component). However, it is unlikely to uncover balance sheet misstatements explicitly, such as an overstatement in assets or equity."}

Tranches are slices of the CDO, where senior tranches have priority in repayment and lower risk, while junior tranches are subordinate and absorb losses first, making them riskier.\n\nSenior tranches typically have higher credit ratings and lower associated risk because they have priority on cash flows. Junior tranches have lower credit ratings and higher associated risk because they are last in line for payment and first to bear losses.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nd. A lower credit rating than senior tranches and higher associated risk."}
