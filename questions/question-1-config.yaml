query: "What is the effect of incorporating  degree‐heterogeneous networks structure in an SEIR model on disease dynamics, compared to a homogeneous‐mixing network? Analyze it using both deterministic analytical methods and stochastic simulations. Address this question in both scenarios in analytcal and simulation approaches. User is not available to provide more information."
