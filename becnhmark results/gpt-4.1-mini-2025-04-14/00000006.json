Identify the Districts where the winners differ between the two systems.\n4. Take the first letter of each such District's name, in the order of the Districts: Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, Theta, Iota.\n5. Combine those letters to form a word, and provide the answer in all capital letters.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1 & 2: Determine winners under both systems for each District\n\nFrom the data, the Districts and their code ranges are:\n\n- Alpha: 105-114\n- Beta: 115-124\n- Gamma: 125-134\n- Delta: 135-144\n- Epsilon: 145-154\n- Zeta: 155-164\n- Eta: 165-174\n- Theta: 175-184\n- Iota: 185-194\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: First Past The Post (FPTP) winner per District\n\n- For each District, count the number of \"1\" votes for each party.\n- If tie, use \"2\" votes to break, then \"3\", etc.\n\n### Step 2: Points Allocation winner per District\n\n- For each District, calculate total points for each party using the points table:\n  - 1 \u2192 12 points\n  - 2 \u2192 10 points\n  - 3 \u2192 8 points\n  - 4 \u2192 6 points\n  - 5 \u2192 4 points\n  - 6 \u2192 2 points\n  - 7 \u2192 1 point\n  - 8 \u2192 0 points (including unmarked parties)\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Identify Districts with different winners\n\nCompare winners from Step 1 and Step 2 for each District.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Take first letters of Districts with different winners in order\n\n---\n\n### Analysis (Summary of winners per District):\n\nI have analyzed the data and computed the winners for each District under both systems:\n\n| District | FPTP Winner | Points Allocation Winner | Different? |\n|----------|-------------|-------------------------|------------|\n| Alpha    | Orange      | Orange                  | No         |\n| Beta     | Orange      | Orange                  | No         |\n| Gamma    | Yellow      | Yellow                  | No         |\n| Delta    | Red         | Red                     | No         |\n| Epsilon  | Red         | Blue                    | Yes        |\n| Zeta     | Red         | Red                     | No         |\n| Eta      | Orange      | Orange                  | No         |\n| Theta    | Red         | Red                     | No         |\n| Iota     | Blue        | Blue                    | No         |\n\nOnly **Epsilon** has different winners: FPTP winner is Red, Points Allocation winner is Blue.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Form the word from first letters of Districts with different winners\n\nOnly Epsilon differs, so the word is:\n\n- Epsilon \u2192 E\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n\n**E**\n\nSince the question asks for the word formed by the first letters of all such Districts, and only Epsilon differs, the word is simply:\n\n**E**\n\n---\n\n# Answer:\n\nE"}
