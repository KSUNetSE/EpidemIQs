75,000 = 3,701.8 tonnes\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Determine how waste is processed (incineration, recycling, landfill) for each waste type\n\nFrom the flowchart:\n\n- Third party waste (4,142.2 tonnes):\n  - 5% recycled\n  - 70% incinerated\n  - 25% landfilled\n\n- Guaranteed waste (75,000 tonnes):\n  - 5% recycled\n  - 75% incinerated\n  - 20% landfilled\n\n- Additional waste (3,701.8 tonnes):\n  - 5% recycled\n  - 75% incinerated\n  - 20% landfilled\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Calculate tonnes sent to landfill for each waste type\n\n- Third party landfill = 25% \u00d7 4,142.2 = 1,035.55 tonnes\n- Guaranteed landfill = 20% \u00d7 75,000 = 15,000 tonnes\n- Additional landfill = 20% \u00d7 3,701.8 = 740.36 tonnes\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Total landfill tonnes in quarter ending March 2020\n\nSum all landfill amounts:\n\n- Total landfill = 1,035.55 + 15,000 + 740.36 = 16,775.91 tonnes\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Check for any adjustments or notes\n\nThe question options are around 16,327 to 16,335 tonnes, which is significantly less than 16,775.91 calculated.\n\nThis suggests that the \"Authority waste\" used in the flowchart is actually 95% of the **waste received**, but the flowchart says \"Up to first 75,000 tonnes of 95%,\" so the guaranteed waste is capped at 75,000 tonnes, but the total authority waste is 95% of total waste received.\n\nHowever, the flowchart also shows that the \"Remainder of 95%\" goes to additional waste, so the total authority waste is 95% of total waste received.\n\nBut the flowchart also shows that the total waste received is split into:\n\n- 5% third party waste\n- 95% authority waste\n\nThen the authority waste is split into:\n\n- Guaranteed waste: up to 75,000 tonnes\n- Additional waste: remainder of authority waste\n\nThen the waste is split into:\n\n- Recycling: 5%\n- Incineration: 70% or 75%\n- Landfill: 25% or 20%\n\nBut the flowchart shows the percentages for recycling, incineration, and landfill are applied to the waste streams after the initial split.\n\nWait, the flowchart shows:\n\n- For third party waste: 5% recycled, 70% incinerated, 25% landfilled\n- For guaranteed waste: 5% recycled, 75% incinerated, 20% landfilled\n- For additional waste: 5% recycled, 75% incinerated, 20% landfilled\n\nBut the flowchart also shows that the 5% recycling is applied to the total waste received, not to the individual waste streams.\n\nRe-examining the flowchart:\n\n- Total waste received is split into:\n  - 5% third party waste\n  - 95% authority waste\n\n- Then, for third party waste:\n  - 5% recycled\n  - 70% incinerated\n  - 25% landfilled\n\n- For guaranteed waste (up to 75,000 tonnes):\n  - 5% recycled\n  - 75% incinerated\n  - 20% landfilled\n\n- For additional waste (remainder of 95%):\n  - 5% recycled\n  - 75% incinerated\n  - 20% landfilled\n\nSo the recycling, incineration, and landfill percentages are applied to each waste stream separately.\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Recalculate landfill tonnes with more precision\n\n- Third party waste = 5% \u00d7 82,844 = 4,142.2 tonnes\n  - Landfill = 25% \u00d7 4,142.2 = 1,035.55 tonnes\n\n- Guaranteed waste = 75,000 tonnes\n  - Landfill = 20% \u00d7 75,000 = 15,000 tonnes\n\n- Additional waste = 78,701.8 - 75,000 = 3,701.8 tonnes\n  - Landfill = 20% \u00d7 3,701.8 = 740.36 tonnes\n\nSum landfill:\n\n- 1,035.55 + 15,000 + 740.36 = 16,775.91 tonnes\n\n---\n\n### Step 10: Check if the \"95%\" in the flowchart applies to total waste or to waste after recycling\n\nThe flowchart shows the total waste received is split into 5% third party and 95% authority waste.\n\nThen the recycling percentages are 5% of each waste stream.\n\nBut the flowchart shows the recycling percentages as 5% for each waste stream, so the recycling is 5% of each waste stream.\n\nTherefore, the landfill is the remaining percentage after recycling and incineration.\n\n---\n\n### Step 11: Confirm the landfill percentage for each waste stream\n\nFrom the flowchart:\n\n- Third party waste: 5% recycled, 70% incinerated, 25% landfill (adds to 100%)\n- Guaranteed waste: 5% recycled, 75% incinerated, 20% landfill (adds to 100%)\n- Additional waste: 5% recycled, 75% incinerated, 20% landfill (adds to 100%)\n\n---\n\n### Step 12: Final check for quarter ending March 2020\n\nThe answer options are around 16,327 to 16,335 tonnes, which is about 16,330 tonnes.\n\nOur calculation is 16,776 tonnes, which is about 446 tonnes higher.\n\n---\n\n### Step 13: Check if the \"95%\" in the flowchart is applied to total waste received or to total waste received minus recycling\n\nThe flowchart shows the total waste received is split into 5% third party and 95% authority waste.\n\nBut the flowchart also shows that the recycling is 5% of each waste stream.\n\nSo the recycling tonnage is 5% of each waste stream, and the landfill is the remaining percentage after recycling and incineration.\n\n---\n\n### Step 14: Alternative approach: Calculate landfill as 5% of total waste received\n\nThe flowchart shows the total waste received is split into:\n\n- 5% third party waste\n- 95% authority waste\n\nThen the waste is split into recycling, incineration, and landfill.\n\nThe landfill tonnage is:\n\n- Third party landfill = 25% of 5% total waste = 0.25 \u00d7 0.05 \u00d7 82,844 = 1,035.55 tonnes\n- Guaranteed landfill = 20% of 75,000 tonnes = 15,000 tonnes\n- Additional landfill = 20% of (0.95 \u00d7 82,844 -

However, the question asks for total revenue received from guaranteed waste gate fees, which includes the minimum charge.\n\nGiven the data and instructions, the total revenue is the sum of quarterly fees at inflated rates for 75,000 tonnes each quarter.\n\nThe calculated total is approximately $202,145,400, but the options given are around $198,184,476 to $198,184,484.\n\nThis suggests the model might have a slightly different inflation application or period count.\n\n### Step 6: Recalculate with exact inflation application and period count\n\n- The model period is from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2030 = 13 years = 52 quarters.\n- Inflation is applied on 1 January each year, so for quarters in the same year, fee per tonne is constant.\n- Use exact inflation formula: Fee for year n = 45 \u00d7 (1.02)^(n-2017)\n\nCalculate sum of fees per quarter over 52 quarters:\n\nSum of fees = 75,000 \u00d7 [4 \u00d7 (45 \u00d7 1.02\u00b9) + 4 \u00d7 (45 \u00d7 1.02\u00b2) + ... + 4 \u00d7 (45 \u00d7 1.02\u00b9\u00b3)]\n\nThis is:\n\nSum = 75,000 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 45 \u00d7 \u03a3 (1.02^k) for k=1 to 13\n\nCalculate \u03a3 (1.02^k) for k=1 to 13:\n\nThis is a geometric series:\n\nSum = 1.02 \u00d7 (1.02^13 - 1) / (1.02 - 1)\n\nCalculate:\n\n1.02^13 \u2248 1.29687\n\nSum = 1.02 \u00d7 (1.29687 - 1) / 0.02 = 1.02 \u00d7 0.29687 / 0.02 = 1.02 \u00d7 14.8435 = 15.140\n\nNow calculate total revenue:\n\nTotal = 75,000 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 45 \u00d7 15.140\n\nCalculate stepwise:\n\n- 75,000 \u00d7 4 = 300,000\n- 300,000 \u00d7 45 = 13,500,000\n- 13,500,000 \u00d7 15.140 = 204,390,000\n\nThis is higher than the options.\n\n### Step 7: Check if the first year is 2018 or 2017 for inflation application\n\nThe base fee is 45 in 2017 prices, inflation applied on 1 Jan 2018 means first year fee is 45 \u00d7 1.02^0 = 45 (no inflation for 2018?), or 45 \u00d7 1.02^1 = 45.9?\n\nThe problem states inflation applied such that on 1 Jan 2019, one year inflation is applied. So for 2018, fee is $45 (no inflation yet).\n\nSo inflation years are from 2019 to 2030 (12 years), not 13.\n\nRecalculate sum for k=0 to 12 (13 terms), with k=0 for 2018 (no inflation):\n\nSum = \u03a3 (1.02^k) for k=0 to 12\n\nCalculate:\n\nSum = (1.02^13 - 1) / (1.02 - 1) = (1.29687 - 1) / 0.02 = 14.8435\n\nTotal revenue = 75,000 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 45 \u00d7 14.8435 = 13,500,000 \u00d7 14.8435 = 200,396,250\n\nStill higher than options.\n\n### Step 8: Consider that the guaranteed waste fee is paid for 75,000 tonnes per quarter, but the actual guaranteed wasteflow data from Assumptions sheet shows values slightly less than 75,000 in some quarters, so the fee is still for 75,000 tonnes, but overcharged tonnage is written off against additional waste in later quarters, reducing total revenue.\n\nHence, total revenue from guaranteed waste gate fees is less than the above calculation.\n\n### Step 9: Use the provided data from Assumptions sheet for guaranteed waste amount per quarter:\n\nGuaranteed waste amount per quarter = 75,000 tonnes"}
