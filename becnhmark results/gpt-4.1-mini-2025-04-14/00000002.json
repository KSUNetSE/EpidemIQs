Removal of excess cash  \n- This is a common normalized adjustment because excess cash is not required for operations and can distort valuation.\n\nb. Inventory adjustment when inventory is recorded on a FIFO basis  \n- Adjusting inventory valuation methods (e.g., FIFO to LIFO or average cost) can be part of normalization to reflect consistent accounting policies or economic reality.\n\nc. Reasonable compensation for owners  \n- Adjusting owner compensation to a reasonable market level is a classic normalized adjustment to reflect true operating expenses.\n\nd. Bad debt adjustment for a significant write off due to an unexpected bankruptcy filing by a major customer  \n- This is a one-time, non-recurring event. Normalized adjustments usually remove such unusual, non-recurring items to show ongoing earnings. However, this is an adjustment for a specific event, not a general category of normalized adjustments.\n\nTherefore, option d is not a general category of normalized adjustments but rather a specific, non-recurring adjustment.\n\n**Answer: d.

Doubtful accounts, notes receivable, leases  \n- Doubtful accounts (allowance for bad debts) can be adjusted to reflect realistic collectability.  \n- Notes receivable may be reviewed if they are related party or non-operating.  \n- Leases may be reviewed for operating vs capital treatment.  \nThis option includes relevant categories.\n\nb. Notes receivable, leases, compensation but not liabilities and insurance  \n- Notes receivable and leases as above.  \n- Compensation is often normalized to reflect market rates.  \n- Excluding liabilities and insurance is questionable since insurance expenses may be adjusted if non-recurring or unusual.  \nThis option partially fits but excluding liabilities and insurance is less typical.\n\nc. Inventory methods, depreciation methods but not non-operating items  \n- Inventory and depreciation methods are important for normalization to ensure consistency.  \n- However, excluding non-operating items is incorrect because non-operating items are typically removed or adjusted in normalization.  \nSo this option is incorrect.\n\nd. Capitalization and expensing, recognition of income, and expenses and taxes but not nonrecurring or extraordinary costs  \n- Capitalization and expensing policies and recognition of income/expenses and taxes are important.  \n- However, excluding nonrecurring or extraordinary costs is incorrect because these costs are usually adjusted out in normalization.  \nSo this option is incorrect.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe best answer is **a.
