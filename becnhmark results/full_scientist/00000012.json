This discrepancy suggests the actual correct repayment amount is likely close to these options, but based on the provided model data and instructions, the calculated repayment is $448,064.\n\nTherefore, without additional data or rounding details from the model, we cannot exactly match the options, but the closest calculated figure is $448,064 for the repayment amount."}
