This indicates a mistake in scaling or interpretation.\n\nUpon review, it appears the 'Roll' columns were misinterpreted or the category 'High and Often' was not calculated correctly (likely counting with raw dice values instead of the expected range). Also, very high scores like over a million should not arise given the dice rolls.\n\nTo rectify:\n- The scoring for 'High and Often' should be the highest roll times its count.\n- All other categories follow as per the rules.\n\nRecalculation with accurate scaling is required.\n\n---\n\nI will now fix the scoring logic for the \"High and Often\" category and confirm results respect expected possible ranges before finalizing."}
