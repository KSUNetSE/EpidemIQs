While inflation and cost parameters are available from the problem statement, the critical quarterly tonnage and throughput data in 2027\u2014including volumes of guaranteed authority waste, additional authority waste, third party waste, and the splits into incinerated, recycled (silver, copper, iron), and landfill categories\u2014are not accessible or absent in the sheet structures analyzed.\n\nThis lack of flow data blocks the construction of an accurate financial model for 2027 revenues and costs. Fixed costs such as incinerator running costs and penalty costs can be inflation-adjusted as per the introduction but cannot be fully summed without verifying landfill tonnage totals for penalty applicability.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to provide a numeric answer for total cash revenues less total costs for 2027 from the data supplied.
