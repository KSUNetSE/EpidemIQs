Additionally, there are no hidden sheets, hidden rows, or hidden columns that might contain this data. The limited numeric data present does not correspond to debt amounts for different years.\n\nTherefore, the workbook as provided does not contain the necessary debt details to progressively fix errors or calculate the total debt from the Revolver and other three debt facilities for Year 5. Without these data, it is impossible to compute or select the closest answer from the given options.\n\nRecommendation: A corrected and complete version of the model including detailed debt schedules and year-wise data must be obtained in order to answer the question accurately per the task instructions.\n\nAnswer: Cannot determine from the current workbook data."]
["00000043", "False", "D", "After thoroughly examining the provided Excel workbook, including searching for hidden sheets, rows, columns, named ranges, and analyzing formulas and values to detect errors such as circular references or incomplete formulas, the spreadsheet contains minimal data and only two formulas that do not calculate correctly due to missing or incomplete references.\n\nThe cells and their formulas do not explicitly or implicitly indicate the starting cash balance for Year 1, and none of the given multiple-choice options ($728, $2027, ($43), $457) appear or approximate any calculated or stored values in the model.\n\nGiven that the deliberate errors in the model prevent calculation or display of the correct cash balance, and no fixable formula or value is found within the workbook to represent the starting cash balance at Year 1, the correct answer cannot be extracted or derived from this file.\n\nTherefore, without additional data, error correction, or further instructions, the starting cash balance at Year 1 cannot be conclusively determined from the model provided."]
["00000043", "False", "A", "The provided Excel file contains only one sheet named 'Sheet'. The data in this sheet does not include any clear rows or columns labeled with 'Cash available for debt repayment' or any yearly breakdown for Years 1 to 5. It appears that the relevant data for calculating the total cumulative 'Cash available for debt repayment' over Years 1-5 is either missing or not explicitly labeled in the given file.\n\nTherefore, without the corrected and complete data or relevant sections in the workbook, it is not possible to accurately calculate or identify the total cumulative cash available for debt repayment for Years 1-5.\n\nIf you can provide additional data or sheets with the relevant information, I can assist further in identifying errors, fixing them, and calculating the requested total. As it stands, there is no basis in the provided data to select one of the options a, b, c, or d."]
