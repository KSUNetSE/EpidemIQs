Interest rate increases on its debt facilities during the year.\n\nExplanation:\n- Changes in the Net Working Capital position do impact Free Cash Flow for the Firm as they affect the cash available.\n- A loan amortization payment falling due impacts Free Cash Flow because it is a cash outflow.\n- Interest expense changes due to rate increases affect net income but interest itself is not included in Free Cash Flow for the Firm calculations since FCF is calculated before interest.\n- A reduction in the tax rate impacts Free Cash Flow as it changes the net income and cash taxes paid.\n\nTherefore, interest rate increases on debt (option c) do not directly impact Free Cash Flow for the Firm."}

No, Fair Value may include some other value to a buyer that the open market does not recognise thereby making Fair Value greater than Market Value in some cases. \n\nFair Value and Market Value are related but distinct concepts. Market Value generally refers to the price at which an asset would trade in an open and competitive market. Fair Value, on the other hand, is a more comprehensive valuation that may consider additional factors, including subjective value to a particular buyer, which might not be recognized in the open market. Therefore, Fair Value can sometimes be greater than Market Value."}

For example, using ROW(1:5) will generate the array {1,2,3,4,5}. This can be done without the need for other functions.\n\n- OFFSET requires additional parameters and often other functions to generate arrays.\n- INDEX retrieves values from arrays but does not generate sequential arrays by itself.\n- COLUMNS returns the number of columns in a reference and does not generate sequential arrays.\n\nTherefore, the function that can be used alone to generate a sequential one-dimensional array is ROW."}
