Without the installation data by month, it is not possible to calculate the total cumulative rated capacity of all installed systems as of 15 September 2014 precisely. However, the question options suggest cumulative rated capacity values around 4,000 kW to 6,000 kW. Given the installation period from July 2013 to June 2015, a reasonable estimate for the cumulative rated capacity by September 2014 would be approximately 5,000 kW (choice b), assuming installations were progressive and moderate over the 27 months installation period."}

However, this value is much lower than any of the provided multiple choice options. This discrepancy arises because the actual installation monthly details and exchange rates were not available from the provided workbook and the assumptions were made (10 small and 5 large systems installed monthly over the installation period). To answer the question accurately, the actual installation monthly data from the workbook is necessary.\n\nSince the installation details were not retrievable, the answer based on these calculations cannot be matched confidently to any of the supplied multiple choice options."}
