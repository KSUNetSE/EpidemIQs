This is because you cannot repay more than what you owe (the revolver balance) or more than the cash you have available.\n\nHence, the correct answer to the question is:\n\nb. Yes, because the maximum payment able to be made is the lower of the balance of the Revolver and the cash available\n\nThis approach manages cash reserves properly and prevents over-repaying beyond available cash or outstanding debt.\n\nIf you want me to analyze any other parts or if you have a corrected or updated version of the model containing the Debt sheet, please provide it."}
