However, Year 1 is not one of the options provided in the question.\n\nAmong the given options, the IRR values are:\n- Year 2: 21.97%\n- Year 5: 4.50%\n- Year 6: 2.28%\n- Year 8: -0.54%\n\nTherefore, the highest IRR among the available choices is achieved by exiting in Year 2. This makes option a. Year 2 the correct answer.\n\nEarly exit tends to yield a higher IRR because it allows faster capital recovery and captures the initial growth and income more effectively. The model accounts for mortgage repayments, tax deductions, and rental income increases based on the assumptions given in the introduction, reinforcing the accuracy of this conclusion."}
