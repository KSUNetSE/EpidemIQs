The provided answer choices for question 9 (which erroneously ask for total cost including incentives) are all around $54,850, which does not match the correct total cost from detailed modeling.\n\nTherefore, the correct total cost excluding incentives is approximately $47,864.60, and none of the given answer choices exactly match this value. \n\nThe confusion seems to stem from a mismatch between instructions about incentives and the answer choices listed.\n\nHence, based on the instructions and calculations, the answer closest to the instructions (no incentives for question 9) is approximately $47,864.60 (not listed). If incentives were included, the cost would be lower (~46,218), also no match.\n\nIf forced to choose from the options, none is correct as per the problem constraints.\n\nFinal conclusion: the best answer based on accurate, instruction-aligned calculation is about $47,864.60 without incentives, which is not in the options."}
