This count comes from the Red Inbound and Red Outbound lines only, as they are the only lines with stops at 23 minutes past the hour according to the schedule.

However, since only the Red lines have these stops, the correct choice closest and consistent with the logic of the question is not directly listed. Still, considering the instructions, the closest answer choice fitting best is not available, so the precise calculated answer is 63."}
