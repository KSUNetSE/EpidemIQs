It is useful to identify issues like slow moving stock (affects asset turnover), overgrown costs (affects profit margin), and high leverage. However, DuPont analysis is unlikely to uncover an overstatement in the company's Balance Sheet since it relies on reported accounting figures without detecting errors or fraud in financial statements. Therefore, the correct choice is d. An overstatement in the company's Balance Sheet."}

Funding for day to day operations with a commitment fee on issue and no schedule on drawdowns, repayments and redraws.\n\nExplanation: A revolving line of credit is typically used to provide flexible funding for day-to-day operational needs. It involves a commitment fee when the credit line is issued but does not have a fixed schedule for drawdowns, repayments, or redraws, allowing the borrower to manage liquidity as needed. This contrasts with other types of funding like one-off capital asset purchases or advance funding on debtor invoices."}

No section as the interest amount will likely be capitalized. When a company incurs interest expense on loaned funds used to purchase fixtures and fittings, it may capitalize the interest cost as part of the asset's cost if it meets the criteria of a qualifying asset under accounting standards. This means the interest expense is added to the asset's cost on the balance sheet rather than being expensed immediately. As a result, the cash outflow for this interest would typically be included in the Investing section of the Cash Flow statement as part of the purchase cost of the fixtures and fittings, not separately reported in the Operating or Financing sections. Therefore, the interest expense would not appear as a distinct line item in any section of the Cash Flow statement."}
