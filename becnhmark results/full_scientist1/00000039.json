This is significantly higher than the options provided (a. $1.5m, b. $1.7m, c. $1.9m, d. $2.1m). Given the details, the repayment profile clearly states equal total payments starting immediately, so the repayment should reduce principal steadily from the initial $14 million.\n\nTherefore, based on all correct assumptions and calculations, none of the provided options match the accurate closing balance. The computed balance is closest to $6.65 million, not in the $1.5m to $2.1m range listed. \n\nHence, there is possibly a discrepancy in the question's provided answer options or a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the repayment schedule for Tranche 1."}
