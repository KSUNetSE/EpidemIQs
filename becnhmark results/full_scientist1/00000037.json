It helps identify issues such as slow-moving stock (through asset turnover), overgrown direct and indirect costs (through profit margin), and higher than acceptable leverage (through financial leverage). However, DuPont analysis is unlikely to uncover an overstatement in the company's Balance Sheet, as this represents financial statement manipulation or distortion that is not directly indicated by these components. Therefore, the correct answer is d. An overstatement in the company's Balance Sheet."}

It is commonly used to provide flexible funding for day-to-day operations without a fixed schedule for drawdowns or repayments. This flexibility helps businesses manage cash flow fluctuations easily. \n\nReviewing the options:\n- a: One-off funding for non-current capital asset purchase is typically served by term loans, not a revolving line of credit.\n- b: Advance funding on approved debtor invoices is more characteristic of invoice financing, not an RLOC.\n- c: Funding for day to day operations with a commitment fee and no fixed schedule on drawdowns, repayments, and redraws fits the description of an RLOC.\n- d: Funding for day to day operations under an agreed repayment schedule minimizing interest is more aligned with term loans or structured loans, rather than a revolving credit line.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is c: Funding for day to day operations with a commitment fee on issue and no schedule on drawdowns, repayments and redraws."}
