No, Fair Value may include some other value to a buyer that the open market does not recognise thereby making Fair Value greater than Market Value in some cases. This is because Fair Value considers a broader set of assumptions including market participant perspectives and is not strictly limited to observable market prices. Therefore, Fair Value can sometimes be higher than Market Value as it incorporates values recognized by informed buyers in orderly transactions that may not be visible in the open market. The other options b, c, and d are incorrect as they misinterpret the relationship between Fair Value and Market Value."}
