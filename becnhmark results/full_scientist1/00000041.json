It seems the full CFADS here includes all net income after tax plus the interest expense.\n\nHowever, if the question intends CFADS to be net income after tax before adding back interest (a common interpretation in some contexts), that figure is $17,258.80, which closely matches option a. 17,259.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice for CFADS at the end of the first year is:\na. 17,259"}

This value is significantly lower than all the multiple-choice options provided (a. 820,296; b. 822,122; c. 824,825; d. 826,020), which seem to assume that early repayments are not made.\n\nTherefore, if early repayments are properly accounted for as stated in the problem, the closing principal is about $647,491 at year 4, which does not match the given choices. If early repayments are ignored, a standard amortizing loan calculation gives a closing principal closest to option a) $820,296.\n\nConsidering the problem states all free cash flow is used to repay principal, the most accurate estimate of closing principal at end of year 4 is $647,491, which does not align with the options given.\n\nHence, the final conclusion:\n- With early repayments, closing principal $\u007f647,491$ (not in choices)\n- Without early repayments (standard amortization), closing principal closest to $820,296$ (option a)\n\nThe correct answer based on assumptions should be a) 820,296 if ignoring early repayment; otherwise, actual is lower than all options."}
