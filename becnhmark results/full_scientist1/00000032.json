The average based on available data is approximately 0.845 kWh per hour. Given the missing data and assuming usage consistent with the average, the corrected average remains about 0.845 kWh. Among the provided options (a) 0.760 kWh, (b) 0.784 kWh, (c) 0.808 kWh, and (d) 0.833 kWh, none exactly matches the computed average. The closest option remains (d) 0.833 kWh. Therefore, the most accurate and reasonable choice is d) 0.833 kWh, recognizing small discrepancies due to incomplete data."}
