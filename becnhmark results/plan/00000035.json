The payment timing on opening payables extends through December 2013, but after that purchases must be paid according to the schedule of 85%, 10%, and 5% in the subsequent three months. \n\nMultiple attempts to calculate the closing accounts payable at December 2015 using the available data and the payment schedules suggest the closing accounts payable is significantly less than the multiple-choice options given (around $10,885 to $15,440).\n\nBecause of this discrepancy and the absence of a clear monthly forecasted accounts payable figure in the provided sheets, the most plausible way to answer is to select the choice closest to the pattern of payments and initial balance diminishing over time.\n\nGiven the options:\n- a. $647,000\n- b. $764,000\n- c. $772,000\n- d. $779,000\n\nThe initial accounts payable is $350,000 and the forecast should logically not grow to above $700,000 without large unaccounted purchases or payment delays.\n\nSince the data and calculations show the payable reducing, the closest plausible option is (a) $647,000, which might account for some forecasted buildup unseen explicitly in the data provided.\n\nFinal answer: a. $647,000"}
