A MIN statement should be used in this case because the maximum payment able to be made is the lower of the balance of the Revolver and the cash available. This ensures that repayment does not exceed either the amount owed or the cash resources on hand. The explanations for the options are as follows:\n\na. No, the minimum payment is not usually made to best manage cash reserves. Typically, repayment aims to minimize interest cost and avoid overpayment.\n\nb. Correct, the maximum payment possible is indeed the minimum of the amount owed (revolver balance) and the cash available. This prevents paying more than either available cash or the revolver balance.\n\nc. No, cash available is not the largest possible payment if it exceeds the revolver balance; you cannot repay more than what you owe.\n\nd. No, using a MAX statement would incorrectly increase the payment amount beyond constraints, failing to limit repayment correctly."}
