Since the options are close, let's reconsider if we should use cumulative (total) inflation or average inflation for the conversion.\n\nOn revisiting, generally the nominal exchange rate after n years = Spot rate * (1 + total US inflation) / (1 + total Euro inflation). Our calculation used cumulative inflation correctly. However, since the options are slightly lower, it might be a rounding or provided rates context.\n\nGiven the choices, the closest lower value to our calculation is option d. 1.324, which aligns best as a nominal exchange rate in year 7.\n\nHence, the correct choice is:\n\nAnswer: d. 1.324"}

This discrepancy likely arises from missing or assumed data (notably the opening balances of the tax asset classes) in the workbook provided.\n\nGiven the available data and assumptions made, the calculation steps are as follows:\n- Convert Year 4 (2018) sales, opex, and depreciation from real to nominal US$ using US inflation of 2%.\n- Calculate depreciation using the double declining balance method for Class A and straight line for Class B with assumed opening balances.\n- Calculate Earnings Before Tax (EBT) = Sales - Opex - Depreciation in nominal US$.\n- Convert EBT from nominal US$ to nominal Euros using the spot exchange rate of 1.31 US$ per 1 Euro.\n\nTherefore, none of the multiple choice options (a, b, c, d) are correct based on the extracted and assumed data.
