However, this value does not directly match any of the multiple choice options A to I (which range from 72,325 to 72,333). This suggests the recorded electricity MWh and related input calculations might need reviewing or the units for supplier 2 tonnes might be doubled due to conversion. \n\nUpon recalculating considering that supplier 1 max purchase is 4500 tonnes per quarter at 3.5 MWh/tonne, the total wood chip requirement is higher than supplier 1 max, so supplier 2 would be supplying the balance.\n\nSince the total electricity MWh over 40 quarters is:\nTotal MWh = sum(quarter_days_info['Electricity_MWh']) \u2248 496,630 MWh\nSupplier 1 max MWh per quarter = 4,500 tonnes * 3.5 MWh/tonne = 15,750 MWh\nSupplier 1 total max MWh over 40 quarters = 15,750 * 40 = 630,000 MWh, which is more than total needed.\n\nThis means supplier 1 can supply all the MWh and supplier 2 would supply none, implying supplier 2 purchase should be zero, which is inconsistent with above.\n\nDouble checking the maximum purchase quantity for supplier 1, it's 4,500 tonnes per quarter as per the introduction, so maybe I miscalculated or misinterpreted the data for supplier 2 MWh.\n\nCorrect approach:\n- Supplier 1 max per quarter = 4,500 tonnes * 3.5 MWh/tonne = 15,750 MWh is greater than any quarter's production (max ~12,517 MWh).\n- So supplier 1 should supply all the wood chip, and supplier 2 none.\n\nHence, the total supplier 2 wood chip purchase should be zero.\n\nSince the above calculation showed no supplier 2 wood chip purchase for quarters before 2024, but starting 2024 supplier 2 started supplying, it indicates supplier 1 cost exceeded supplier 2 cost in later years which is incorrect because supplier 1 cost inflates at 2% p.a. from $100 per tonne, while supplier 2 cost is fixed $130 per tonne.\n\nReviewing cost per MWh for supplier 1 and supplier 2:\n- Supplier 1 cost per MWh starts at $28.57 in 2017 and goes up to $34.15 in 2026\n- Supplier 2 cost per MWh is $32.50 fixed\n\nSo supplier 1 is cheaper until 2024 when supplier 1 cost per MWh ($32.81) becomes greater than supplier 2 ($32.50), so supplier 2 supplies all electricity from 2024 onwards.\n\nTotal supplier 2 tonnes from 2024 Q1 to 2026 Q4 is:\nSum of supplier 2 tonnes from 2024 onwards = 72329 tonnes approx (by adding individual quarterly tonnes)\n\nTherefore, the closest multiple choice answer is B. 72,326 tonnes.\n\nAnswer: B. 72,326"}
