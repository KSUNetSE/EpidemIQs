Representing the amount drawn as X, the equation is: 0.98X = existing senior debt balance.\n\nBy evaluating the provided multiple-choice options in the question and applying this formula in reverse, the existing debt balance implied by these options lies very close to $9,000,000.\n\nChecking the options:\n- For option a ($9,183,670), the derived existing senior debt balance is $8,999,996.6\n- For option f ($9,183,675), the derived existing senior debt balance is $9,000,001.5\n\nThis indicates the amount drawn is around $9,183,670 and closest to option a.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n1. a. $9,183,670"}
