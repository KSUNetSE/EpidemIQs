This value does not exactly match any of the options provided (79.0m or 80.2m, Asset or Liability). Given the calculations:\n- Deferred tax = (Accounting Net Value - Tax Net Value) * Tax Rate (28% in 2028)\n- The temporary difference is about 199.5 million, and applying 28% tax rate results in approximately 55.9 million deferred tax liability.\n\nTherefore, none of the given options a), b), c), or d) is correct based on the data and assumptions.\n\nIf forced to choose the closest in nature (sign and approximate magnitude), the answer would be a deferred tax liability (positive deferred tax balance), but the amount differs from the options.\n\nHence, based on calculations, the answer is approximately 55.9m Liability."}
