This corresponds to option C among the multiple-choice answers provided. This conclusion is drawn by integrating the flowchart proportions and the problem requirements, as direct extraction of quarterly waste data from the Excel file was inconclusive. The solution assumes the residual authority waste beyond the guaranteed minimum forms the additional waste, summing over all quarters from 2018 to 2030."}
