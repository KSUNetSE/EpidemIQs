The expected references and formulas appear to be broken or absent, consistent with the analyst's comment regarding errors in volume summary by type.\n\nTherefore, to correct the error:\n1.

Fix or reconstruct formulas for the volume data by properly referencing the correct input data sources.\n3.

Key rows related to 'Tax depreciation' and 'Capital expenditure' were identified by label but contained no usable numeric values for the 15-year forecast period.\n\nGiven that the tax depreciation is supposed to be calculated on a diminishing value basis, the absence of initial capital expenditure and the applicable depreciation rate prevents recalculating or correcting the tax depreciation values in the model.
