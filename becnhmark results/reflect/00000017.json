This model must implement the semi-annual cash flow analysis, priority of payments rules, loan repayment schedules, reserve account targeting, and application of available cash according to Profile 4 over the entire timeline from 2017 to 2035.\n\nThe raw data in the workbook does not straightforwardly provide the maximum MMRA underfunding for Profile 4.

Calculate target MMRA values each period based on the major maintenance cost profile and weighting factors.\n4. Simulate cash receipts and apply the priority of payments rules for Profile 4 cash to determine actual payments and reserve funding.\n5. Calculate the underfunding (target minus actual MMRA balance) per period.\n6.
