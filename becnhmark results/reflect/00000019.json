This is confirmed by examining balances at year ends around that period.\n\nGiven that this year (2053) lies beyond the multiple-choice options provided (2029 to 2037), none of the listed choices A through I is correct. Therefore, Bob's account does not exceed $200,000 within the multiple-choice range. \n\nThis answer includes all provided assumptions and is consistent with the detailed financial modeling.\n\nIn summary: Bob's account balance first exceeds $200,000 in 2053, which is outside the options provided in the question."}
